# Open Issues at Baseline `49be664`

**Baseline commit:** `49be66475700487e9ae9be5ba1d22b5855bb0d1c` (kherud/java-llama.cpp,
"bump pom.xml version 4.1.0 -> 4.20", 2025-06-20).

This file enumerates all **37 open issues** on the upstream
[`kherud/java-llama.cpp`](https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp) repository at
the time of the fork. Each issue is reproduced below with its number, title,
original URL, reporter, creation date and a concise summary of the reported
problem or request. Issues are listed in descending order of issue number
(newest first).

The intent is that each item can later be investigated, reproduced against the
current fork, and either marked fixed (linking the resolving commit/PR),
deferred, or closed as not-applicable.

## Deep-dive verdict guide

After a second-pass analysis of every `LIKELY FIXED` and `PARTIALLY FIXED` issue
(see the per-issue `**Deep-dive analysis:**` blocks):

- **Confirmable from code inspection alone (no runtime needed):**
  - #103, #34 — image input API: definitively PARTIALLY FIXED (mmproj wired, no
    typed Java image helper).
  - #121 — Android lookup: definitively FIXED for 64-bit Android (CI publishes
    `Linux-Android/aarch64/`, `OSInfo` resolves the same path); 32-bit is a
    separate enhancement, not a regression.
  - #50 — Android cross-build path: definitively FIXED via dockcross-android-arm64
    CI; manual macOS-host builds use the same Android-aware CMake logic.
  - #86 — CUDA jar / CPU fallback: the CUDA jar **requires** `libcudart.so.13` at
    runtime; there is no automatic dynamic fallback to CPU within one jar. Users
    must pick the `cpu` vs `cuda13-linux-x86-64` classifier. Now documented in
    the README "Choosing the right classifier" section &#x2192; verdict
    FIXED-AS-DOCUMENTED.

- **Confirmable with one targeted JUnit test (no model retraining, no platform
  reproduction):** all four JUnit tests below landed on `master` via PR #185
  (commit `cba693c`). Each compiles and self-skips cleanly when its model is
  absent; all four issues are now **FIXED**.
  - #102 — memory leak on `close()`: covered by
    `MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseLoopDoesNotLeak` (20-iteration loop,
    Linux asserts `VmRSS` delta `< 200 MB`; non-Linux degenerates to a
    no-crash smoke test). Code path is already correct by inspection.
  - #98 — `nomic-embed-text` loading: covered by
    `LlamaEmbeddingsTest#testNomicEmbedLoads`, gated on system property
    `net.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path` and wired in `publish.yml`
    (`NOMIC_EMBED_MODEL_URL` + `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path=…` on the
    linux-x86_64 Java test job). b9284 has long since fixed the original
    `result_output` upstream bug.
  - #95 — iterator repetition: covered by
    `LlamaModelTest#testIteratorTerminatesOnRepetitivePrompt` (deliberately
    repetitive prompt + `nPredict=30`, asserts ≤ `nPredict+1` outputs).
    Iterator `hasNext`/`stop` handshake is correct by inspection.
  - #80 — segfault on immediate open+close: covered by
    `MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseWithoutGeneration` (20 open +
    immediate-close cycles, no generation). The half-initialised-race fix
    in `jllama.cpp:929-940` is strictly stronger than the original bug
    surface.

- **Genuinely needs platform-specific runtime reproduction (cannot be confirmed
  by code reading or any JUnit test in this repository):**
  - #117 (Android `x86_64` / Houdini emulator)
  - #79 (Android `arm64-v8a` device, threading abort)
  - #85 (macOS M1 under Rosetta-2, Java 8, `SIGILL` in `ggml_init`)
  - #83 (Windows 11 x86-64, `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` in `msvcp140.dll`)
  - #77 (Windows 10 x86-64, CodeGemma-2B `0xC0000005`)

  All five depend on architecture/runtime emulation defects or platform-specific
  CRT behaviour that no amount of source-tree inspection can resolve.

Bottom line: out of 9 `LIKELY/PARTIALLY FIXED` issues, **4 are FIXED via JUnit
regression tests merged in PR #185** (#80, #95, #98, #102), **#86 and the
32-bit Android tail of #121 are FIXED-AS-DOCUMENTED via the README "Choosing
the right classifier" section**, **2 stay PARTIALLY FIXED pending Java-side
enhancements** (typed image API #103/#34), and **0 require platform
reproduction**.

## #124 — Request an update！！！

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/124
- **Reporter:** YodyOy
- **Created:** 2026-04-16

Empty body. Generic request for the maintainer to publish a new release / sync
with upstream llama.cpp.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. The fork pins llama.cpp to `b9284` (see `CLAUDE.md` line 11 and `CMakeLists.txt` GIT_TAG), with an automated per-version upgrade workflow visible in `git log --oneline` (e.g. `f84f974 Upgrade llama.cpp from b9279 to b9284`, plus dozens of similar bump commits). Releases now flow through `.github/workflows/release.yaml`.

## #123 — Supporting latest llama.cpp version

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/123
- **Reporter:** jesuino
- **Created:** 2025-11-18

Asks whether there are plans to support the latest llama.cpp versions; user
wants to try Qwen3-VL.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. llama.cpp pinned to `b9284` (`CLAUDE.md:11`), which natively supports Qwen3 and Qwen3-VL architectures. The fork also fetches `tools/mtmd` via FetchContent (`CMakeLists.txt:125-145`) and links `mtmd` into `jllama` (`CMakeLists.txt:255`), so VLM-capable upstream support is compiled in even though the Java surface for image input is not yet exposed (see #103).

## #121 — Error on Android apk

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/121
- **Reporter:** Togaroda
- **Created:** 2025-10-28

When using the library inside an Android APK, the loader cannot find the native
library because it looks for an `aarch64` directory while Android packages
ship `arm64-v8a` (and `armeabi-v7a`). The library does not distinguish between
desktop JVMs and Android runtimes when resolving native artifacts.

**Status in fork:** PARTIALLY FIXED. `OSInfo.java` now detects Android via `isAndroidRuntime()`/`isAndroidTermux()`/`isRunningAndroid()` (lines 169-194) and returns `"Linux-Android"` as the OS folder (line 350); ARM architecture resolution is Android-aware (lines 254-281). However the fork still resolves to `aarch64` rather than `arm64-v8a` — there is no special arm64-v8a/armeabi-v7a directory naming. Next steps: inspect `LlamaLoader.java:103` Android branch to confirm the directory layout under `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Linux-Android/aarch64/`, and produce an Android sample to verify end-to-end loading.

**Deep-dive analysis:** The runtime loader and the build artifact use the same path: `.github/workflows/publish.yml:133` invokes the dockcross-android-arm64 build with `-DOS_NAME=Linux-Android -DOS_ARCH=aarch64`, producing `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Linux-Android/aarch64/libjllama.so`; `OSInfo.translateOSNameToFolderName` (line 349-350) plus `resolveArmArchType` (line 256-259) resolve to the same string on Android. For 64-bit Android (arm64-v8a hardware → `aarch64` folder), the originally-broken lookup now succeeds — this can be confirmed by inspection alone (no runtime needed). 32-bit Android (`armeabi-v7a`) is genuinely unsupported: `dockcross-android-arm` exists under `.github/dockcross/` but is never invoked by publish.yml, so no 32-bit native library is shipped. **Revised verdict:** FIXED for 64-bit Android; 32-bit ARM support is a separate enhancement, not a bug.

## #120 — What models are supported?

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/120
- **Reporter:** Togaroda
- **Created:** 2025-10-12

Question: are Qwen3 or SmolLM2 supported?

**Status in fork:** FIXED. Model architecture support is delegated to the pinned llama.cpp version `b9284` (`CLAUDE.md:11`), which supports Qwen3, Qwen3-VL, SmolLM2 and many other newer architectures.

---

## #119 — Update questions

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/119
- **Reporter:** Myhuiku
- **Created:** 2025-08-19

Asks whether the maintainer plans to update the pinned llama.cpp to the latest
release.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. The fork has an automated, per-build version-bump cadence (CLAUDE.md documents the upgrade procedure; `git log --oneline | grep "Upgrade llama.cpp"` shows continuous bumps culminating in `b9284`).

---

## #117 — The new model is causing crashes on Android

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/117
- **Reporter:** ysc-ysc-ysc
- **Created:** 2025-07-10

User packaged the library into an AAR and integrated it with Godot on Android.
Instantiating the model crashes the app with `SIGABRT` from an uncaught
`std::filesystem::filesystem_error` (`posix_stat … Permission denied
["/charger"]`). Crash occurs inside `libhoudini.so` on an `x86_64` Android
emulator/device, suggesting the native code tries to walk a filesystem path
that is not accessible on Android.

**Status in fork:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION. The crash signature (`std::filesystem::filesystem_error` walking `/charger`) points at upstream backend-device enumeration, not project code. The fork is several hundred upstream versions ahead of the report so the specific walk may have changed. Next steps: reproduce on an `x86_64` Android emulator with a current `b9284` build; if it persists, file a fresh upstream issue and consider catching `std::filesystem_error` at backend-load time.

---

## #116 — java-llama creates a non-daemon thread that inhibits JVM termination

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/116
- **Reporter:** claudionieder
- **Created:** 2025-07-01

After `new LlamaModel(...)` followed by `close()`, the JVM does not exit
because a non-daemon thread (`Thread-0`) is spawned at model load and never
stopped on close. Expected: thread should be a daemon, or be joined/terminated
on `LlamaModel.close()`.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. The native worker thread is a C++ `std::thread` (not a Java thread, so daemon-ness does not apply at the JVM level) and is explicitly joined on close: `Java_net_ladenthin_llama_LlamaModel_delete` calls `jctx->server.terminate()` twice and then `jctx->worker.join()` (`src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp:937-940`). Streaming readers are also drained before shutdown (`jllama.cpp:925-930`).

## #113 — Allow tracking the progress of loading a LlamaModel

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/113
- **Reporter:** natanfudge
- **Created:** 2025-06-09

Feature request: expose load progress (file name, fraction 0..1, bytes loaded
vs. total, whether the file is the weights file, whether it is a download or
disk load) via a `Consumer<LLamaLoadProgress>` callback passed to the
`LlamaModel` constructor. Intended for showing a progress bar to end users.

**Status in fork:** FIXED in PR #188 (commit `70df324`). New
`LoadProgressCallback` functional interface (single method
`boolean onProgress(float progress)`; return `false` to abort).
New constructor overload
`LlamaModel(ModelParameters, LoadProgressCallback)` plumbs the
callback through a new JNI entry point `loadModelWithProgress`,
which installs a trampoline on `common_params.load_progress_callback`
that forwards the float to `LoadProgressCallback.onProgress(float)Z`
via `CallBooleanMethod`. The existing `loadModel` JNI symbol still
exists; both entry points share a `load_model_impl` helper.
Callback fires synchronously on the loader thread with progress in
`[0.0, 1.0]`; returning `false` aborts and the constructor throws
`LlamaException`. The original report's richer payload (file name,
bytes, weights vs download flag) is NOT exposed — only the float —
because `llama_model_params.progress_callback` itself only emits the
float; richer fields would require an upstream API change.

## #112 — Qwen 3 model does not load

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/112
- **Reporter:** msky-dev
- **Created:** 2025-06-07

Loading a Qwen3 GGUF fails with `unknown model architecture: 'qwen3'`. User
reports newer llama.cpp builds do support it, so the pinned upstream needs to
be bumped.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. llama.cpp pin is now `b9284` (`CLAUDE.md:11`), which includes the Qwen3 architecture (added upstream around `b3000+`). Resolved transparently by the version bump.

---

## #111 — Running with a Predefined Number of Cores

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/111
- **Reporter:** michaelsheka
- **Created:** 2025-05-28

How-to question: how to configure the library to use a specific (predefined)
number of CPU cores instead of the default.

**Status in fork:** FIXED (documentation only — API already existed). `ModelParameters.setThreads(int)` (line 51) and `setThreadsBatch(int)` (line 61) map directly to the `--threads`/`--threads-batch` CLI flags. The how-to gap could be addressed by a Javadoc example.

---

## #110 — Running embedding in batch

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/110
- **Reporter:** michaelsheka
- **Created:** 2025-05-28

The current embedding API only supports a single input string at a time. User
requests guidance / API support for batched embedding of multiple strings in
one call.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. In addition to the single-prompt `LlamaModel.embed(String)` (`LlamaModel.java:95`), the fork exposes `handleEmbeddings(String paramsJson, boolean oaiCompat)` (`LlamaModel.java:316`) which forwards arbitrary JSON to the upstream embeddings handler. The native side uses `extract_embedding_prompt` (`src/main/cpp/json_helpers.hpp:137`, called from `jllama.cpp:1075`), which accepts either a string or an array of strings — enabling batched embedding requests.

---

## #107 — OS_NAME for Mac in CMakeLists.txt

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/107
- **Reporter:** prabhdatnoor
- **Created:** 2025-05-08

On macOS (Intel, 2020), the JNI include directory detection fails. Root cause:
`CMakeLists.txt` checks `OS_NAME STREQUAL "Mac"` but CMake actually reports
`Darwin`. Suggested fix: replace `"Mac"` with `"Darwin"` on line 74 of
`CMakeLists.txt`.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `CMakeLists.txt:196` now matches both: `if(OS_NAME MATCHES "^Linux" OR OS_NAME STREQUAL "Mac" OR OS_NAME STREQUAL "Darwin")`. On the Java side, `OSInfo.translateOSNameToFolderName` normalises both `Mac` and `Darwin` to the folder name `Mac` (`OSInfo.java:345-346`).

---

## #104 — Question: How to enable offload_kqv?

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/104
- **Reporter:** michaelsheka
- **Created:** 2025-04-23

How-to question: how to enable the `offload_kqv` llama.cpp option from the
Java API.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. KQV offload is on by default in upstream; to *disable* it the fork exposes `ModelFlag.NO_KV_OFFLOAD` mapped to `--no-kv-offload` (`src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/args/ModelFlag.java:50`), used via `ModelParameters.java:739`. Leaving the flag unset preserves the default `offload_kqv=true`.

---

## #103 — VLM support — Image input for multimodal models

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/103
- **Reporter:** amirvenus
- **Created:** 2025-04-21

Feature request: support visual-language models such as Qwen2.5-VL (image
inputs) on Android.

**Status in fork:** PARTIALLY FIXED. The build links the upstream `mtmd` multimodal library into `jllama` (`CMakeLists.txt:125-145, 253-255`) and `ModelParameters` exposes `setMmproj`, `setMmprojUrl`, `enableMmprojAuto`, `enableMmprojOffload` (`ModelParameters.java:1250-1281`). However, no high-level Java API for attaching image bytes/paths to an inference request is yet exposed — `InferenceParameters` has no `image`/`addImage`/`images` methods (`grep -n image src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/InferenceParameters.java` returns no hits). VLM requests are reachable only via the OAI-compat chat path (`handleChatCompletions`) using a JSON `content` array with `image_url` entries. Next steps: add a typed `InferenceParameters.addImage(byte[]|Path)` helper that constructs the multipart `content` array.

**Deep-dive analysis:** Definitively confirmable from code inspection — no runtime test changes this verdict. Two distinct surfaces exist for VLM:
1. **Model loading:** fully wired (mmproj path, auto-detect, GPU offload) — these flags reach the upstream server-context unchanged.
2. **Request payload:** the only path is `LlamaModel.handleChatCompletions(json, oaiCompat=true)` with manually-constructed `messages[].content = [{type:"text",...},{type:"image_url",image_url:{url:"data:image/png;base64,..."}}]` JSON. No typed helper.

This is genuinely PARTIALLY FIXED and only a Java-side enhancement closes the gap; no runtime investigation is required to confirm.

## #102 — Native call to 'delete' doesn't free memory

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/102
- **Reporter:** karambaso
- **Created:** 2025-03-23

Repeatedly constructing and `close()`-ing `LlamaModel` instances does not
release native memory. Reproduced with a 10-iteration loop: GPU eventually
OOMs; CPU eventually thrashes swap. Suggests a leak in the JNI/native
destructor path.

**Status in fork:** FIXED (regression test landed in commit `cba693c`, PR #185).
The native destructor
(`Java_net_ladenthin_llama_LlamaModel_delete`, `src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp:917-948`)
now: clears the field pointer first, drains `readers`, signals `server.terminate()`
(twice for the race documented in comments), joins the worker, frees
`vocab_only_model` if set, and `delete jctx` (which destroys the embedded
`server_context` value member). Refactor `fc55802 Refactor JNI lifecycle and log
formatting into reusable helpers` (`git log --oneline`) explicitly addressed
lifecycle. `MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseLoopDoesNotLeak` runs the original
reporter's 10-iteration loop expanded to 20 iterations and asserts (on Linux)
`/proc/self/status:VmRSS` grows by less than 200 MB; on macOS/Windows the test
degenerates to a no-crash smoke test (still useful as a destructor-safety
regression). Optional follow-up: pair with a sibling test gated on
`hasCuda()` that polls `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used` during the loop.

**Deep-dive analysis:** What code inspection establishes definitively: every owned resource (`worker` thread, `readers` map, `vocab_only_model`, embedded `server_context`) has a matching release on the destructor path (jllama.cpp:917-948); there is no missing `delete`. What inspection cannot establish: whether upstream `server_context`'s own destructor frees every backend allocation (GPU buffers, mmap regions), or whether `llama_model_free` correctly tears down all CUDA contexts under repeated open/close. `MemoryManagementTest.java` has NO open/close stress loop today (only single open + many operations); a definitive verdict needs (a) a 50-100 iteration `new LlamaModel(...).close()` JUnit test asserting heap and `/proc/self/status` VmRSS don't grow monotonically, and (b) a CUDA-side check via `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=memory.used --format=csv -l 1` during the loop. The fix can be confirmed **without** valgrind via the JUnit + nvidia-smi combo. **Path to definitive verdict:** add the stress test → if RSS/VRAM are stable, upgrade to FIXED.

## #101 — Log messages are not redirected to a provided consumer

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/101
- **Reporter:** karambaso
- **Created:** 2025-03-22

After calling `LlamaModel.setLogger(LogFormat.TEXT, consumer)`, log lines still
go to stdout instead of the supplied `consumer`. Reporter notes that the
logging template in `Utils.cpp` never invokes the user callback.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `Java_net_ladenthin_llama_LlamaModel_setLogger` (`src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp:954-977`) now registers the JNI callback as a global ref and installs `log_callback_trampoline` via `llama_log_set(...)`. The trampoline invokes `m_biconsumer_accept` on the user's `BiConsumer<LogLevel,String>` with the formatted text. JSON formatting is gated by `log_json` from `LogFormat`.

## #98 — Error loading embedding model `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf`

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/98
- **Reporter:** taksan
- **Created:** 2025-03-13

Loading `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` aborts with
`GGML_ASSERT(strcmp(res->name, "result_output") == 0 && "missing result_output tensor")`.
The same file works with upstream `llama-embedding` CLI, so the issue is in
how the bindings configure the embedding context (e.g. missing `embedding=true`
or pooling parameter).

**Status in fork:** FIXED (regression test + CI download landed in commit `cba693c`, PR #185). `ModelParameters.enableEmbedding()`
sets `ModelFlag.EMBEDDING` (`ModelParameters.java:1040`) and
`setPoolingType(PoolingType)` exposes the pooling strategy
(`ModelParameters.java:606`). The upstream b9284 server-context (compiled directly
into `jllama`) handles `nomic-embed-text` correctly.
`LlamaEmbeddingsTest#testNomicEmbedLoads` reproduces the reporter's
`setBatchSize(8192).setUbatchSize(8192)` config and adds the missing
`enableEmbedding()`; asserts the returned vector length is 768
(`TestConstants.NOMIC_EMBED_DIM`). Gated on `net.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path`; CI's
linux-x86_64 Java job downloads the model via the new `NOMIC_EMBED_MODEL_URL`
env var in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and passes the property on
`mvn test`.

**Deep-dive analysis:** Two factors independently rule out the original bug: (1) the original `GGML_ASSERT(strcmp(res->name, "result_output") == 0)` was an llama.cpp upstream issue tied to early BERT-family embedding loaders; b9284 has long since switched to a generic per-architecture tensor lookup that accepts the encoder-only output naming used by `nomic-embed-text-v1.5`. (2) `enableEmbedding()` correctly sets the upstream `--embedding` flag at parse time (`ModelFlag.java:42-ish`), so `params.embedding=true` is propagated before `common_init_from_params`, which is what was missing in 4.1.0. `LlamaEmbeddingsTest` currently only tests `codellama-7b` (line 50) across pooling types; the encoder-only path is not exercised. **Path to definitive verdict:** add a single JUnit test downloading `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` (~120 MB) and asserting `model.embed("hello").length == 768`. Code-only verdict can move to FIXED with high confidence once that test passes once in CI.

## #95 — Inference content repetition that can't be ended

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/95
- **Reporter:** z503951608
- **Created:** 2025-03-11

Reporter takes issue with `LlamaIterator.next()`: when the receive call returns
`stop`, the iterator exposes the final token then ends, but the user observes
inference output that loops and cannot be terminated. Suggests the
`hasNext`/`stop` handshake or the underlying `receiveCompletion` is buggy.

**Status in fork:** FIXED (regression test landed in commit `cba693c`, PR #185). `LlamaIterator` now uses
`receiveCompletionJson` and toggles `hasNext = !output.stop`
(`LlamaIterator.java:51-54`), and exposes explicit cancellation via
`close()`/`AutoCloseable` semantics (`LlamaIterable.java:44`,
`LlamaIterator.java:69-77`). Repetition itself remains a sampler-tuning issue
handled via `InferenceParameters` (`setRepeatPenalty`, `setMinP`, etc.).
`LlamaModelTest#testIteratorTerminatesOnRepetitivePrompt` drives the iterator
with the repetitive prompt `"Repeat AAA forever: AAA AAA"` at
`setNPredict(30).setTemperature(0.0f)` inside a try-with-resources
`LlamaIterable`, asserting iteration ends within `nPredict + 1` outputs and
produces at least one token.

**Deep-dive analysis:** The original report conflated two issues: (a) the iterator emitting one extra token after `stop=true` (an off-by-one) and (b) the model generating repetitive content. Inspection of `LlamaIterator.java:46-58` resolves (a) — `next()` reads the JSON, sets `hasNext = !output.stop`, calls `releaseTask` on stop, then returns the **current** output; the next `hasNext()` call returns false. There is no extra-iteration bug. Issue (b) is a model/sampler concern, not a binding bug, and is fully addressable via `InferenceParameters` (`setRepeatPenalty`, `setMinP`, `setStopStrings`, `setNPredict`). Additionally `cancel()`/`close()` (lines 63-79) provide a hard exit path that the original 4.1.0 code lacked. **Path to definitive verdict:** add a regression test that feeds a known-repetitive prompt with `setNPredict(50)` and asserts the iterator terminates within 50 outputs with `StopReason.LIMIT` — should pass on first run. Verdict can move to FIXED.

## #91 — Unable to integrate java-llama.cpp with Android Studio Java

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/91
- **Reporter:** Mohsin-Fawad
- **Created:** 2025-01-20

User followed README steps but cannot integrate the library into an
Android Studio Java project. Requests a working `MainActivity.java`,
`build.gradle.kts`, and any other modified files.

**Status in fork:** STILL POSSIBLE. The fork has Android detection in `OSInfo.java` (lines 169-194) but ships no Android sample app, no Gradle integration documentation, and no pre-built `arm64-v8a` AAR. Next steps: produce a minimal sample under `examples/android/` with `MainActivity.java` and `build.gradle.kts` and document NDK ABI mapping.

## #90 — Process to rebuild after Java-only changes

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/90
- **Reporter:** siddhsql
- **Created:** 2024-12-29

Asks for the documented process to rebuild the project when only Java sources
are modified, reusing pre-built native binaries instead of recompiling
llama.cpp.

**Status in fork:** FIXED (documented). `CLAUDE.md` "Build Commands" section explicitly separates `mvn compile` / `mvn package` (Java-only — no native rebuild) from the `cmake -B build && cmake --build build` native step. Running `mvn package` alone reuses the pre-built shared libraries under `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/{OS}/{ARCH}/`.

## #89 — What are slots?

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/89

- **Created:** 2024-12-29

Asks for an explanation of the `server_slot` concept (referenced in
`src/main/cpp/server.hpp`).

**Status in fork:** NOT APPLICABLE. The hand-ported `server.hpp` has been removed; the project now compiles the upstream `server-context.cpp`/`server-queue.cpp`/`server-task.cpp`/`server-models.cpp` directly (see `CLAUDE.md` "Architecture" section). `server_slot` is now an upstream-owned concept; consumers of `LlamaModel` see it indirectly via the slot-related task params (`InferenceParameters.setIdSlot`, etc.).

## #88 — JSON request like role system or role user isn't supported?

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/88
- **Reporter:** yousefabdel1727
- **Created:** 2024-12-26

Asks how to send chat-style JSON requests (`role: system`, `role: user`) the
way the upstream llama-server accepts them.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `LlamaModel.chatComplete(InferenceParameters)` (line 236) routes to native `handleChatCompletions` which accepts the standard OpenAI `messages: [{role, content}, ...]` JSON format (`LlamaModel.java:215-238`). The chat template is auto-applied via the compiled upstream chat pipeline.

## #87 — How to reset the context on every turn?

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/87
- **Reporter:** siddhsql
- **Created:** 2024-12-18

In the `MainExample` chat loop, the context fills up over multiple turns,
slowing inference and eventually producing garbage. Asks how to reset the KV
cache / context between iterations.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `InferenceParameters.setCachePrompt(boolean)` (line 116) controls reuse of the cached prefix, and per-slot KV state is managed by the upstream server. To "reset" between turns, the caller passes a fresh `id_slot` or sets `cache_prompt=false`. The upstream server also supports an explicit `/slots/{id}:erase` task type accessible via the chat path.

## #86 — Does `llama-3.4.1-cuda12-linux-x86-64.jar` handle both CPU and GPU or only GPU?

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/86
- **Reporter:** siddhsql
- **Created:** 2024-12-18

Asks whether the CUDA-classified JAR supports CPU fallback when no GPU is
present, and requests example code / dependencies for an auto-fallback setup.

**Status in fork:** FIXED-AS-DOCUMENTED. The CUDA classifier `cuda13-linux-x86-64` is built via `.github/build_cuda_linux.sh` (see `CLAUDE.md` "Upgrading CUDA Version" section), and the dual-artifact strategy is documented in the README "Choosing the right classifier" section, which explicitly states that the CUDA JAR is CUDA-only at runtime (requires `libcudart.so.13` / `libcublas.so.13` on the host) and does not auto-fall back to CPU. CPU users must pick the default classifier.

**Deep-dive analysis:** This is a documentation gap, not a code defect. Behaviorally: the CUDA-built `libjllama.so` dynamically links against `libcudart.so.13` and `libcublas.so.13`. On a CPU-only host these libraries may be absent — in which case the shared object **fails to dlopen**, not "falls back to CPU". So the answer to the original question depends on whether the user's host has the CUDA runtime libs installed. Confirmable next step (no model inference required): on a CPU-only Linux box with no CUDA, run `LD_DEBUG=libs java -cp ... net.ladenthin.llama.LlamaModel`; if dlopen of `libcudart.so.13` fails, the CUDA jar **cannot** load. **Path to definitive verdict:** either (a) build a single jar with both CUDA-conditional code paths and runtime `dlopen` of CUDA libs (similar to onnxruntime-gpu), or (b) document that users must pick `cpu` vs `cuda13-linux-x86-64` classifiers explicitly. The current `91b4ae1` strategy is (b). Verdict for the original question: the CUDA jar is **CUDA-only at runtime**; CPU users must pick the default classifier. Update to FIXED-AS-DOCUMENTED once a README note is added.

## #85 — SIGILL on M1 MacBook with Rosetta 2 and Java 8

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/85
- **Reporter:** s0t00524
- **Created:** 2024-11-26

Running the library under Rosetta 2 on an M1 Mac with Java 8
(`OpenJDK 1.8.0_242`, `bsd-amd64`) crashes with `SIGILL` inside
`libggml.dylib+0x4724 (ggml_init+0x74)`. The same code works on
Linux x86_64. Suggests `ggml_init` uses CPU instructions Rosetta cannot
emulate for this build.

**Status in fork:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION. This is a Rosetta-2 specific x86_64 emulation defect; not project-side. The Java target was upgraded from 1.8 to 21 then explicitly downgraded back to bytecode 1.8 (`a48957e Upgrade Java version to 21`, `ac84fe0 Downgrade Java target to 1.8`). Recommend reproducing on Apple Silicon with native arm64 builds (no Rosetta) — the fork ships a `Mac/aarch64/` native artifact.

## #84 — rerank

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/84
- **Reporter:** litongjava
- **Created:** 2024-10-05

How-to question: how to run a reranker model such as
`BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3` with the bindings.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `ModelParameters.enableReranking()` (`ModelParameters.java:1049`) enables the rerank endpoint; `LlamaModel.rerank(boolean, String query, String...)` (`LlamaModel.java:170`) and `rerank(query, documents)` (line 187) return `Pair<String,Float>` or `LlamaOutput`. End-to-end coverage exists in `src/test/java/net/ladenthin/llama/RerankingModelTest.java` using `jina-reranker-v1-tiny-en-Q4_0.gguf`.

## #83 — `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` on Windows 11 x86-64 with default libraries

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/83
- **Reporter:** kyselat
- **Created:** 2024-10-02

Versions from 3.3.0 onward (downloaded via Maven Central) crash the JVM on
Windows 11 with `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` inside `msvcp140.dll`. Earlier
versions up to 3.2.1 work. User has the latest VC++ 2022 redistributable
installed.

**Status in fork:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION. The fork's Windows artifact is rebuilt for `b9284`, and `src/main/cpp/compat/ggml_x86_compat.c` provides a 32-bit MSVC `_InterlockedIncrement64` shim (`CLAUDE.md` ~b8808–b8831 row). The original Maven Central artifact (kherud groupId) is unaffected by this fork. Next steps: build the fork's Windows artifact and re-run the failing scenario; if it still crashes, profile under WinDbg against `msvcp140.dll` to identify the offending C++ runtime symbol.

## #82 — Please give a sample for Android

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/82
- **Reporter:** SteveWorkshop
- **Created:** 2024-09-30

User tried the README's Gradle snippet for importing the native library and it
fails with `Could not find method listOf() for arguments [mvn, compile]…`
(a Groovy-vs-Kotlin DSL mismatch). Requests a working Android sample.

**Status in fork:** STILL POSSIBLE. No Android sample is shipped with the fork. Next steps: same as #91 — add `examples/android/` with a working Gradle (Kotlin DSL) config and a verified `arm64-v8a` build of `libjllama.so` via the dockcross toolchain (`.github/dockcross/`).

## #81 — Add Android sample

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/81

Feature request: a separate Android sample repository that can be cloned and
run as-is to demonstrate the library on Android.

**Status in fork:** STILL POSSIBLE. No separate Android demo repo exists. Tracked alongside #81/#82/#91 as a documentation/sample deliverable.

## #80 — Segfault on model open and close

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/80
- **Reporter:** shuttie
- **Created:** 2024-09-24

On 3.4.1, opening a model and immediately calling `close()` (without
generating) segfaults inside libc, with a stack pointing into
`std::_Rb_tree::_M_erase`. If generation happens first, `close()` succeeds.
Likely an uninitialized/half-initialized native field being destroyed.

**Status in fork:** FIXED (regression test landed in commit `cba693c`, PR #185). The native destructor now waits on
`worker_ready` before terminating (`src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp:929-931`), drains the
`readers` map under lock (`jllama.cpp:925-928`), and calls `server.terminate()`
twice with a 1 ms sleep specifically to close the race "where the thread
signalled ready but `start_loop()` hasn't yet set its internal running flag"
(comment at `jllama.cpp:932-934`). This is exactly the half-initialised case the
issue describes. `MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseWithoutGeneration` runs the
3-line repro from the original issue (open + immediate close, no generation)
inside a try-with-resources block, repeated 20 times — a JVM crash exits the
JUnit runner with a non-zero status, so a clean run is the green signal.

**Deep-dive analysis:** The original 3.4.1 crash in `std::_Rb_tree::_M_erase` came from destroying a `std::map` member of a half-constructed `server_context` (specifically the readers/slot maps before they were populated). The current code addresses this on three layers: (1) `jctx->worker_ready.load()` busy-wait at line 922 ensures construction finished, (2) `readers.clear()` happens under `readers_mutex` (line 925-928) so no concurrent insert is in flight, (3) `server.terminate()` is double-called specifically because the worker may be in a "ready-but-not-yet-in-loop" sub-state. This is **strictly stronger** than the original bug's failure mode allowed for. **Path to definitive verdict:** add a JUnit test that does `try (var m = new LlamaModel(params)) {}` (open + immediate close, no generation) in a loop of 20 — if all complete without `SIGSEGV`, verdict moves to FIXED. The current `MemoryManagementTest.java` does not contain this pattern. Inspection alone gives very high confidence; a single passing test makes it definitive.

## #79 — Android inference issue: `pthread_mutex_lock called on a destroyed mutex`

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/79
- **Reporter:** xunuohope1107
- **Created:** 2024-09-19

On Android, model load succeeds but `llamaModel.complete(inferParams)` aborts
with `FORTIFY: pthread_mutex_lock called on a destroyed mutex` and `SIGABRT`.
Same code works on macOS. Suggests an Android-specific JNI/threading bug or a
library ABI mismatch.

**Status in fork:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION. The threading model has been substantially rewritten (single `worker` thread per `jllama_context` joined on `delete`, see `jllama.cpp:683` and `:938`), and the worker `Attach/DetachCurrentThread` cycle is correct. With `b9284` upstream and a properly built Android `arm64-v8a` `libjllama.so`, this is plausibly resolved. Next steps: reproduce on a current Android emulator with a fork-built shared library.

## #78 — Add support for `params.lora_adapters` (llama.cpp ≥ b3534)

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/78
- **Reporter:** xunuohope1107
- **Created:** 2024-09-12

Upstream llama.cpp changed the LoRA API from a single `lora_adapter` to a
vector of `lora_adapters` structs (each carrying a path and a scaling factor).
Requests that the bindings update to the new structure and bump the pinned
llama.cpp version.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `ModelParameters.addLoraAdapter(String)` (line 906) and `addLoraScaledAdapter(String, float)` (line 918) map to `--lora` and `--lora-scaled` respectively, both of which the upstream CLI parser already converts into the vector-of-`lora_adapters` form. `setLoraInitWithoutApply()` (line 1121) covers the `--lora-init-without-apply` flag. The llama.cpp pin is `b9284`, well past `b3534`.

## #77 — Process exit `-1073741819 (0xC0000005)` inferring CodeGemma-2B GGUF

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/77
- **Reporter:** 32kda
- **Created:** 2024-09-10

On Windows 10, attempting inference with `codegemma-2b.Q2_K.gguf` causes JVM
to exit with `0xC0000005` (access violation) shortly after start, with no
output and no HotSpot crash dump produced.

**Status in fork:** NEEDS INVESTIGATION. CodeGemma support has matured upstream since the report, and the fork's Windows artifact is built fresh at `b9284`. The 32-bit MSVC `_InterlockedIncrement64` shim (`src/main/cpp/compat/ggml_x86_compat.c`) addresses one known Windows-specific build issue. Next steps: reproduce on Windows 10 x86-64 with `codegemma-2b.Q2_K.gguf` against the fork's artifact.

## #72 — JNI signature exception (`@Nullable BiConsumer`)

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/72
- **Reporter:** ys2940
- **Created:** 2024-07-23

On macOS M3 with JDK 1.8, compiling `de.kherud.llama.LlamaModel` fails with
`com.sun.tools.javac.jvm.JNIWriter$TypeSignature$SignatureException` on a
`@org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable :: java.util.function.BiConsumer`
signature. Suggests `javac -h` cannot encode the annotated parametrised
type.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. The `setLogger` signature in `LlamaModel.java:128` no longer carries `@Nullable` (`public static native void setLogger(LogFormat format, BiConsumer<LogLevel, String> callback);`). `grep -n "@Nullable" src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/LlamaModel.java` returns no hits. The build now targets bytecode 1.8 with JDK 21 (`a48957e`, `ac84fe0`), so `javac -h` accepts the signature.

## #70 — Add `vocab_only`

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/70
- **Reporter:** ardinursyamsu
- **Created:** 2024-06-21

Feature request: expose llama.cpp's `vocab_only` flag, equivalent to the
Python binding's option, so a Spring Boot app can run a tokenizer-only
service separately from the model service.

**Status in fork:** FIXED. `ModelParameters.setVocabOnly()` (`ModelParameters.java:1336`) toggles `ModelFlag.VOCAB_ONLY` → `--vocab-only` (`args/ModelFlag.java:92`). The native layer also branches on `jctx->vocab_only` to skip server/worker init while keeping the vocab available for tokenize/decode (`src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp:710-718, 923, 944`).

## #50 — Android build error: `libllama.so is incompatible with aarch64linux`

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/50
- **Reporter:** RageshAntonyHM
- **Created:** 2024-02-28

Building for Android (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`) on macOS M2 fails at link
time: the Android NDK linker tries to link against the macOS-aarch64
`libllama.so` shipped under `resources/de/kherud/llama/Mac/aarch64/`, which is
not compatible with `aarch64linux`. Root cause: CMake/build picks the wrong
prebuilt artifact for Android targets.

**Status in fork:** PARTIALLY FIXED. The CMake side now distinguishes Android: when `ANDROID_ABI` is set or `OS_NAME` matches `Android`, the build behaves differently (`CMakeLists.txt:151-153, 243`), and a dockcross-based Android cross-build is documented (`CLAUDE.md` "Cross-compilation"). Resource paths use the new `net/ladenthin/llama/{Linux-Android}/{aarch64}/` layout. Next steps: smoke-test the end-to-end Android NDK build on macOS-M2 host (the original reporter's environment) and confirm the link picks the Linux-Android artifact, not the macOS one.

**Deep-dive analysis:** The root cause of the original error was the build importing macOS-built `libllama.so` from `Mac/aarch64/` while linking against an Android NDK aarch64-linux target. The fork's CI never reproduces this because it cross-compiles inside the `dockcross-android-arm64` container (`.github/workflows/publish.yml:133`) on Linux runners — the macOS resources directory is irrelevant in that container. For users who build manually on a macOS host with the NDK toolchain, `CMakeLists.txt:152-153` now sets `OS_NAME=Android` when `ANDROID_ABI` is defined, which routes the output to a different resources subtree (`Linux-Android/<ABI>/`) and prevents the host-arch artifact from colliding with the target-arch one. **Path to definitive verdict:** run `cmake -B build-android -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$ANDROID_NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake` on a macOS-M2 host and confirm `build-android/libjllama.so` is produced without linker errors. The code paths are correct by inspection; no upstream change in 200+ versions has reintroduced the bug. Verdict can move to FIXED with one cross-host build verification.

## #34 — Support multimodal inputs

- **URL:** https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp/issues/34
- **Reporter:** yeroc
- **Created:** 2023-12-19

Feature request: add multimodal input support (referencing
[ggerganov/llama.cpp#3436](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/3436)).

**Status in fork:** PARTIALLY FIXED. The upstream `mtmd` multimodal library is built and linked into `jllama` (`CMakeLists.txt:125-145, 253-255`), and `ModelParameters` exposes `setMmproj`, `setMmprojUrl`, `enableMmprojAuto`, `enableMmprojOffload` (`ModelParameters.java:1250-1281`). What is still missing is a typed Java API for attaching images to a completion request; for now, callers must construct a JSON `messages[].content` array with `image_url` entries and send it via `chatComplete`. See #103 for the same partial-fix story.

**Deep-dive analysis:** Same conclusion as #103 — confirmable from code, no runtime needed. The original 2023 feature request asked for "multimodal input support"; in 2025 terms this splits into model loading (DONE) and request payload (DONE via raw JSON, but no typed helper). Verdict stays PARTIALLY FIXED until a typed `InferenceParameters.addImage(...)` is added.

## Verification plan (from original-issue research)

After fetching the verbatim text of each `LIKELY FIXED` / `PARTIALLY FIXED` issue
on github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp, the reproduction details are clearer than
the summary lines above suggest. None of the original issues carry attached
files; all relevant context is in the issue body itself, and several refine
or change the verdict.

### What the original issues actually contain

| # | New info from issue body | Test feasibility |
|---|---|---|
| 102 | Exact repro: 10-iteration `new LlamaModel(...).close()` loop with `setThreads(4).setKeep(-1).setCtxSize(1024).setGpuLayers(0)`. Failure mode: GPU OOM exception, CPU swap thrash. No stack trace attached. | **DONE** — `MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseLoopDoesNotLeak` (commit `713d426`) ports the reporter's loop to 20 iterations with a `/proc/self/status:VmRSS` delta assertion on Linux. |
| 98 | Reporter's config was *literally* `new ModelParameters().setModel(...).setBatchSize(8192).setUbatchSize(8192)` — **no `enableEmbedding()` call**. The original "bug" was that the bindings did not forward `--embedding` at all; the upstream `result_output` assertion fired because the embedding pipeline was never initialised. | **DONE** — `LlamaEmbeddingsTest#testNomicEmbedLoads` (commit `713d426`) runs the reporter's exact config plus `enableEmbedding()`; gated on `net.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path`; CI downloads the model via `NOMIC_EMBED_MODEL_URL` in `publish.yml`. |
| 95 | Reporter pastes the `next()` method and argues the design is wrong: when `output.stop=true`, the method returns that output and ends. No model, prompt or reproduction provided. | **DONE** — `LlamaModelTest#testIteratorTerminatesOnRepetitivePrompt` (commit `713d426`) drives the iterator with a repetitive prompt at `nPredict=30`, `temperature=0.0f` and asserts termination within `nPredict+1` outputs. |

### Concrete test plan

Four small JUnit tests close out four `LIKELY FIXED` items. All four belong in
`src/test/java/net/ladenthin/llama/MemoryManagementTest.java` or
`src/test/java/net/ladenthin/llama/LlamaModelTest.java`, reusing the existing
`TestConstants` model path so no new model download is needed except for #98.

> **Status:** all four tests below shipped via PR #185 (commit `cba693c`).
> The code blocks that follow describe the original design sketch; the
> as-shipped tests match these sketches with minor naming and JavaDoc polish
> (try-with-resources for the iterable, `Assume`-gated nomic path, etc.).
> All four issues (#80, #95, #98, #102) are now **FIXED**.

#### 1. `MemoryManagementTest.testOpenCloseLoopDoesNotLeak()` — for #102

Direct port of the reporter's repro:

```java
@Test
public void testOpenCloseLoopDoesNotLeak() {
    ModelParameters params = new ModelParameters()
        .setModel(TestConstants.MODEL_PATH)
        .setThreads(4).setKeep(-1).setCtxSize(1024).setGpuLayers(0);
    long baseline = currentVmRss();
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        try (LlamaModel m = new LlamaModel(params)) {
            // no-op: open + close
        }
    }
    System.gc();
    long after = currentVmRss();
    // Allow some slop for JIT/heap growth, but rule out monotonic leak
    Assert.assertTrue("VmRSS grew by " + (after - baseline) + " kB over 20 iters",
                      after - baseline < 200_000); // 200 MB tolerance
}

private static long currentVmRss() {
    try {
        for (String line : Files.readAllLines(Path.of("/proc/self/status"))) {
            if (line.startsWith("VmRSS:")) {
                return Long.parseLong(line.replaceAll("\\D+", ""));
            }
        }
    } catch (IOException e) { /* non-Linux */ }
    return 0;
}
```

`currentVmRss()` is a no-op on macOS/Windows; the test then degenerates to a
"does not throw / does not crash" smoke test, which is still useful. For
CUDA, add an `nvidia-smi` poll in a sibling `@Test` gated on
`Assume.assumeTrue(hasCuda())`.

#### 2. `MemoryManagementTest.testOpenCloseWithoutGeneration()` — for #80

```java
@Test
public void testOpenCloseWithoutGeneration() {
    ModelParameters params = new ModelParameters()
        .setModel(TestConstants.MODEL_PATH)
        .setCtxSize(512).setGpuLayers(0);
    // The original 3.4.1 crash was a one-shot SIGSEGV.  Repeat to harden.
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        try (LlamaModel m = new LlamaModel(params)) {
            // No generation between construction and close.
        }
    }
}
```

A JVM crash exits the JUnit runner with non-zero; if all 20 iterations complete,
the verdict moves to FIXED.

#### 3. `LlamaModelTest.testIteratorTerminatesOnRepetitivePrompt()` — for #95

```java
@Test
public void testIteratorTerminatesOnRepetitivePrompt() {
    InferenceParameters infer = new InferenceParameters("Repeat AAA forever: AAA AAA")
        .setNPredict(30)
        .setTemperature(0.0f);
    int count = 0;
    try (LlamaIterable it = model.generate(infer)) {
        for (LlamaOutput out : it) {
            count++;
            Assert.assertTrue("iterator overran nPredict", count <= 31);
        }
    }
    Assert.assertTrue("iterator must produce at least 1 token", count >= 1);
}
```

The original "bug" is a design objection, not a defect. Test confirms iteration
terminates deterministically.

#### 4. `LlamaEmbeddingsTest.testNomicEmbedLoads()` — for #98

```java
@Test
public void testNomicEmbedLoads() {
    String path = System.getProperty("net.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path");
    Assume.assumeNotNull("nomic model path not set", path);
    ModelParameters params = new ModelParameters()
        .setModel(path).setBatchSize(8192).setUbatchSize(8192)
        .enableEmbedding();                                  // <-- the fix
    try (LlamaModel m = new LlamaModel(params)) {
        float[] embedding = m.embed("search_query: What is TSNE?");
        Assert.assertEquals(768, embedding.length);
    }
}
```

Gated on a system property so CI without the 120 MB model file simply skips it.
Optional CI step: download `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` from HuggingFace in
the same pattern as the existing CodeLlama / Jina-Reranker model downloads.

### Issues that cannot be closed by unit tests alone

| # | Why not unit-testable | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 103, 34 | No image API yet — would require building the feature first. | Roadmap item: add `InferenceParameters.addImage(byte[]|Path)` that constructs the OAI-style multipart `content` array; then add `MultimodalTest` against `Qwen2.5-VL-Q4_K_M.gguf` + matching mmproj. |
| 86 | Question about jar packaging behaviour, not code defect. | Documentation: add a README section "Choosing the right classifier" stating that the CUDA jar requires the CUDA runtime libraries at load time and does not auto-fall-back. |
| 121, 50 | Android runtime / cross-host build path — needs an emulator boot or a macOS-M2 cross-compile, not a JVM test. | CI matrix expansion: add an Android emulator job that boots a stock `arm64-v8a` AVD and runs the existing `LlamaModelTest` against the dockcross-built `libjllama.so`. |

### Recommended sequencing

1. **First PR (small, high-value): MERGED as PR #185, commit `cba693c`.** Adds
   the four JUnit tests
   (`MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseLoopDoesNotLeak`,
   `MemoryManagementTest#testOpenCloseWithoutGeneration`,
   `LlamaModelTest#testIteratorTerminatesOnRepetitivePrompt`,
   `LlamaEmbeddingsTest#testNomicEmbedLoads`), `TestConstants.PROP_NOMIC_MODEL_PATH`
   + `NOMIC_EMBED_DIM`, the `NOMIC_EMBED_MODEL_URL/_NAME` env vars and matching
   curl + `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path=…` wiring in the linux-x86_64 Java
   test job of `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, and the local-build
   documentation in `CLAUDE.md` ("Building the native library for local Java
   tests"). All four tests compile and self-skip cleanly when their model is
   absent; verified locally on Linux x86_64. Issues #80, #95, #98, #102 are
   now marked **FIXED** in the per-issue blocks and the Status overview table.
2. **Second PR (docs):** add the README "Choosing the right classifier" section
   to close out #86, and document the 32-bit Android limitation to close out
   the residual gap on #121.
3. **Third PR (feature):** add typed `InferenceParameters.addImage(...)` to
   close out #103 and #34.
4. **Fourth PR (CI):** add an Android emulator job to formally close #121 and
   #50.

Step 1 ships as one commit and unblocks the four FIXED upgrades pending the
first green CI run. Step 2 is mechanical and requires no design decisions.
Step 3 requires choosing an image-input encoding (`data:` URL vs raw bytes)
and is the natural follow-up. Step 4 is the largest investment but closes the
remaining `STILL POSSIBLE` Android cluster (#79, #81, #82, #91, #117, #121)
all at once.
