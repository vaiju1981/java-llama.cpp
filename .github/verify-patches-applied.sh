# Asserts that every llama/patches/*.patch really reached the fetched llama.cpp tree.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The patch applier (llama/cmake/apply-llama-patches.cmake) is fail-loud on
# "does not apply", so a *stale* patch cannot ship silently. What it cannot detect is a patch
# that stops having an effect while still applying, and most patches do not need this check
# because they have a runnable guard that reds CI on every platform if they go missing:
#
#   0003, 0006, 0007, 0008  -> jllama.cpp / native_server.cpp call the symbols they add,
#                              so dropping one is a compile or link error.
#   0011                    -> the ContentOnlyParseUtf8 tests in src/test/cpp/test_utils.cpp.
#   0012                    -> src/test/cpp/test_model_split.cpp.
#   0001, 0002              -> model-gated Java jobs (Windows argv, LoadProgressCallbackTest).
#
# `0010` is the exception and the reason for this script. It casts one enum to int inside
# upstream's `get_res_model_info()`, which is `static` in server-context.cpp and therefore
# unreachable from jllama_test; reverting it leaves `ctest` completely green. Its only guard is
# NativeServerAttachIntegrationTest.models_reportNumericVocabType, which is model-gated — so the
# day a platform stops downloading models, the regression ships. This check runs in the
# always-on `C++ Tests` job, needs no model, and costs milliseconds.
#
# Usage: .github/verify-patches-applied.sh [<llama.cpp-src-dir>]
# Exit codes: 0 all good, 1 a check failed.
