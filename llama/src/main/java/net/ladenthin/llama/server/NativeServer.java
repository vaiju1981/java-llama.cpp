/**
 * Runs the <em>full</em> upstream llama.cpp HTTP server — including its embedded
 * <strong>WebUI</strong> — inside {@code libjllama}, driven over JNI, with no separate
 * {@code llama-server} executable. It is the second of two server modes, the native counterpart to
 * the Java-transport {@link OpenAiCompatServer}.
 *
 * <p>The constructor takes the raw llama-server command-line arguments and forwards them verbatim
 * to the native entry point ({@code llama_server}), so <em>every</em> llama-server flag is supported
 * ({@code -m}, {@code -c}, {@code -b}, {@code -ub}, {@code -ngl}, {@code -t}, {@code -tb},
 * {@code -ctk}, {@code -ctv}, {@code --jinja}, {@code --chat-template-kwargs}, {@code --host},
 * {@code --port}, {@code --ui}/{@code --no-ui}, …). Unlike {@link OpenAiCompatServer}, no per-flag
 * Java mapping is involved.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Two lifecycles.</strong> The classic constructor ({@link #NativeServer(String...)})
 * loads its <em>own</em> model from the forwarded arguments — exactly like running
 * {@code llama-server.exe} — and is unrelated to any {@link LlamaModel} you may also have open;
 * while it runs it owns the process-wide llama backend and routes llama.cpp logging to
 * stderr/file (llama-server's own logging), not the JNI log callback. The <em>attach</em>
 * constructor ({@link #NativeServer(LlamaModel, String...)}) instead serves an
 * <strong>already-loaded</strong> {@code LlamaModel} — no second copy of the weights, no second
 * model load: the model's own worker thread keeps driving inference and the HTTP routes post
 * tasks to its queue. In attach mode the arguments carry only the HTTP-side flags
 * ({@code --host}, {@code --port}, {@code --api-key}, …; no {@code -m}), and the caller keeps
 * full ownership of the model: <strong>do not {@code close()} the model while the server is
 * attached</strong> — stop the server first (server before model, like unwinding
 * try-with-resources).</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Router mode.</strong> Starting without any model argument puts the upstream server
 * in router mode ({@code --models-dir}, {@code GET/POST /models}, per-request model selection).
 * The router serves each model from a <em>worker subprocess</em> that upstream spawns by
 * re-executing its own binary — which, inside a JVM, is {@code java}, not a llama-server. Set
 * {@link #setWorkerCommand(String...)} before starting a router so workers relaunch through this
 * library instead, e.g. {@code setWorkerCommand(javaBin, "-cp", classpath,
 * "net.ladenthin.llama.server.NativeServer")} — each worker is then a fresh JVM running the
 * classic single-model {@code NativeServer}.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Single instance per process.</strong> The upstream server keeps its shutdown state in
 * file-scope globals, so only one {@code NativeServer} may run at a time; {@link #start()} throws if
 * another instance is already running.</p>
 *
 * <p>Typical use:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (NativeServer server = new NativeServer(
 *         "-m", "models/model.gguf", "--host", "127.0.0.1", "--port", "8080", "-c", "65536").start()) {
 *     // Server (and WebUI at http://127.0.0.1:8080/) runs on a native worker thread.
 *     // Readiness: poll GET /health until it returns {"status":"ok"}.
 *     Thread.currentThread().join();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Platform note.</strong> The native methods are compiled into {@code libjllama} on all
 * platforms except Android (the upstream server pulls in {@code posix_spawn_*}, unavailable there);
 * on Android use {@link OpenAiCompatServer}. No SSL: the embedded server is plain HTTP — bind
 * localhost or front it with a TLS proxy.</p>
