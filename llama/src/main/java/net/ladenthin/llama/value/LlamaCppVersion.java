 * <p>{@link #LLAMA_CPP_VERSION} is a pure-Java string ({@code "b9990"}) that mirrors the
 * {@code GIT_TAG} in {@code llama/CMakeLists.txt}. It is available even when {@code libjllama} is
 * absent (pure-Java checkout, before {@code System.load}), which is what makes it suitable for a
 * lightweight version badge in Android or other UIs.</p>
 *
 * <p>For the <em>authoritative</em> value that is baked into the native binary — the build number
 * plus the resolved upstream commit, e.g. {@code "b9990-0badc06ab"} — call
 * {@link net.ladenthin.llama.LlamaModel#getLlamaCppBuildInfo()} instead; that reads llama.cpp's own
 * {@code build-info} through JNI and therefore cannot drift from the compiled library (but requires
 * the native library to be loaded).</p>
