# apply-llama-patches.cmake — applies every patch in the repo-root `patches/` directory to the
# llama.cpp source tree fetched by FetchContent. Wired as the llama.cpp `PATCH_COMMAND` in the
# top-level CMakeLists.txt, so it runs for EVERY C++ build (all CI jobs + local) from one place,
# rather than per-build-step.
#
# Design:
#   * Cross-platform: invoked via `cmake -P`, so it behaves identically on Linux, macOS and
#     Windows (the dockcross/native/MSVC jobs all call the same code path).
#   * Every `patches/*.patch` and `patches/*.diff` is applied, sorted by filename (so a numeric
#     prefix like 0001-, 0002- defines a deterministic order).
#   * Idempotent, via a stamp file rather than per-patch probing. The stamp
#     (`${LLAMA_SRC}/.jllama-patches-applied`) records the checked-out llama.cpp commit plus the
#     SHA-256 of every patch, and the decision is driven by whether the source tree is pristine:
#       - clean tree  -> nothing is applied yet (a fresh fetch, or a re-checkout after a version
#                        bump), so apply all patches forward and write the stamp;
#       - dirty tree  -> already patched; skip when the stamp matches this exact commit + patch
#                        set, and fail loudly when it does not.
#     A per-patch `git apply --reverse --check` cannot do this: `--check` never mutates the tree,
#     so an earlier patch whose region a later patch rewrote (today 0001 vs 0006/0007 in
#     tools/server/server.cpp) always reverse-checks as "not applied" and the forward re-apply
#     then aborts an otherwise harmless reconfigure. The stamp is state, but it is state derived
#     from — and invalidated by — both inputs that matter.
#   * Fail-loud: a patch that no longer applies (e.g. after a llama.cpp version bump shifts the
#     context) aborts the configure with a clear message, so a stale patch can never be silently
#     dropped from a release build.
#   * A source tree that is not a git work tree (e.g. supplied via
#     `-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LLAMA.CPP=<path>`) has no clean/dirty oracle and no HEAD, so it
#     falls back to the legacy per-patch reverse-check path, with the caveat described above.
#
# Invoked as:
#   cmake -DPATCH_DIR=<repo>/patches -DLLAMA_SRC=<fetched-src> -P cmake/apply-llama-patches.cmake

# Content oracle for the WORKING TREE.
#
# The commit + patch hashes below describe what SHOULD be applied; they say nothing about what
# the files actually contain. Reverting one patched file after a successful apply therefore left
# the stamp valid and the tree still dirty (the other patched files are still modified), so the
# dirty-tree branch reported "already applied — skipping", exited 0, and the build compiled
# unpatched code. This fingerprint closes that: it hashes the tree's actual modifications, so a
# reverted or hand-edited file changes it and the stamp stops matching.
#
# Two sources, because neither alone is enough: `git diff` carries the CONTENT of modifications
# to tracked files, and `git status --porcelain` carries the PRESENCE of untracked files (patch
# 0012 adds tests/test-model-split.cpp, which `git diff` never sees). The stamp itself is
# untracked and is filtered out, or writing it would change the fingerprint that describes it.
#
# Residual hole, stated rather than papered over: an edit to the *body* of an untracked file a
# patch added is not detected. Closing that would mean hashing every untracked file's contents;
# the CI-side .github/verify-patches-applied.sh covers the case that actually matters.
