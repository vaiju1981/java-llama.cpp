# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Java bindings for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) via JNI, providing a high-level API for LLM inference in Java. The Java layer communicates with a native C++ library through JNI.

Current llama.cpp pinned version: **b10909**

## Upgrading CUDA Version

Current CUDA version: **13.3**

To change the CUDA version, update the following **three** places:

1. **`.github/build_cuda_linux.sh`** — Line 16: `sudo dnf install -y cuda-toolkit-13-3`
2. **`.github/build_cuda_linux.sh`** — Line 41: `-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER=/usr/local/cuda-13.3/bin/nvcc`
3. **`llama/pom.xml`** — The `<classifier>` tag in the `cuda` jar execution: `cuda13-linux-x86-64`

Also update the header comment in `build_cuda_linux.sh` and the job name in `.github/workflows/release.yaml` for clarity.

Available CUDA versions for RHEL8/Manylinux_2_28 can be browsed at:
```
https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/rhel8/x86_64/
```

**Note:** Each CUDA version supports only certain GCC versions. If the dockcross container uses a newer GCC than CUDA supports, the build will fail with `unsupported GNU version`. Check NVIDIA's compatibility table before downgrading CUDA.

Example: To upgrade from 13.3 to a hypothetical 13.4:
```bash
# Edit .github/build_cuda_linux.sh:
#   line 10: cuda-toolkit-13-3 -> cuda-toolkit-13-4
#   line 12: /usr/local/cuda-13.3/bin/nvcc -> /usr/local/cuda-13.4/bin/nvcc
# Edit llama/pom.xml classifier: cuda13-linux-x86-64 (major version only, no need to change for minor bumps)
# Edit CLAUDE.md line: Current CUDA version: **13.3** -> **13.4**
git add .github/build_cuda_linux.sh llama/pom.xml CLAUDE.md
git commit -m "Upgrade CUDA from 13.3 to 13.4"
```

### Fast local CUDA builds (`CUDA_FAST_BUILD`) — single-arch speed knob

The CUDA artifact must ship kernels for **every supported GPU generation**, so the default
build — and every CI build — compiles the **full `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` set** that
ggml/llama.cpp selects. nvcc recompiles each `.cu` kernel once per architecture, which is the
dominant cost of the ~70 min CUDA job. **`sccache` now wraps nvcc too:** `build.sh` adds
`-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` for CUDA builds (it detects `GGML_CUDA` in the cmake
args), so the per-arch `.cu` device passes are cached over Depot alongside the gcc C/C++ TUs.
Because the kernels are content-addressed and llama.cpp is pinned, a **warm** cache recompiles
only what changed — so CI keeps the **full arch set on every run** (release-safe everywhere)
and relies on the cache, not a reduced arch set, for speed. The first (cold-cache) run still
pays the full nvcc cost; the win shows on subsequent warm runs.

`CUDA_FAST_BUILD` remains as a **local-dev** single-arch knob (CI no longer sets it).
`build_cuda_linux.sh` honors it — default **off** (full arch set, release-safe):

```bash
# Full release build (default): all archs — slow, runs on every GPU generation.
.github/build_cuda_linux.sh "-DOS_NAME=Linux -DOS_ARCH=x86_64"

# Fast local dev build: one arch only. Defaults to `native` (the build machine's own GPU;
# needs a GPU present at configure time). Override with CUDA_ARCH=<cc>, e.g. CUDA_ARCH=90.
CUDA_FAST_BUILD=1 .github/build_cuda_linux.sh "-DOS_NAME=Linux -DOS_ARCH=x86_64"
CUDA_FAST_BUILD=1 CUDA_ARCH=90 .github/build_cuda_linux.sh "-DOS_NAME=Linux -DOS_ARCH=x86_64"
# Direct-cmake equivalent: cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=native
```

**Default + CI policy (release-safety is the invariant).** An artifact built with `CUDA_FAST_BUILD`
runs on only the single GPU generation it was compiled for, so the **distributed jar must always be
the full arch set**. The script default is **off** (full) so any *local/manual* build is
release-safe, and **CI no longer sets `CUDA_FAST_BUILD` at all** — the `crosscompile-linux-x86_64-cuda`
job always builds the full set on PR / push / dispatch / publish, so every artifact (not just the ones
that reach Central) runs on every GPU generation. The full-arch CI cost is absorbed by the
sccache-over-Depot cache, which now wraps nvcc (`-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache`, added by
`build.sh` for CUDA builds, gated behind the same probe). The launcher is safe to enable
unconditionally: if sccache cannot wrap nvcc it runs it directly (uncached), and `build.sh`'s
mid-build retry treats an sccache `Compiler not supported` failure like any other cache error and
rebuilds the job without the launcher rather than redding it. **Verified:** a warm run in the
manylinux_2_28 container hit **100%** on CUDA / CUBIN / device-code (139 CUDA hits, 99.86% overall,
3 misses) and cut the job from **~51 min cold to ~15 min warm** — nvcc caching works here. `build.sh`
prints `sccache --show-stats` at the end of every run so the hit table stays visible.

## Android minimum API level

Current Android minimum API level: **28** (Android 9.0 Pie)

This is enforced through bionic's **weak-symbol** mechanism, *not* by bumping
`__ANDROID_API__` or passing `-DANDROID_PLATFORM`. See "How the API gate is
satisfied" below for why. To change anything here, update:

1. **`llama/CMakeLists.txt`** — the `add_compile_definitions(__ANDROID_UNAVAILABLE_SYMBOLS_ARE_WEAK__)`
   block and its Android-detection guard (`OS_NAME MATCHES "Android"` etc.).
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** (this file) — the "Current Android minimum API level" line above.
3. **`README.md`** — the minimum-API note (the `[!NOTE]` block near the Android
   classifier entries and the "Importing in Android" section).

**Why API 28?** `mtmd-helper.cpp` (part of the upstream llama.cpp `mtmd`
multimodal library) includes `vendor/sheredom/subprocess.h`, which calls
`posix_spawn`, `posix_spawnp`, and `posix_spawn_file_actions_*`. Bionic only
exposes those `<spawn.h>` declarations once the minimum SDK is ≥ 28 (and
`getifaddrs`/`freeifaddrs` in `<ifaddrs.h>`, used by cpp-httplib, at ≥ 24). The
symbols exist in `libc.so` at all API levels; bionic only hides the
*declarations* below the introducing API.

**How the API gate is satisfied (important — the obvious fixes do not work).**
The CI cross-compiler is the `dockcross-android-arm64` image, which is **not**
the Google NDK CMake toolchain — it is a Debian-style cross-clang at
`/usr/aarch64-linux-android/bin/clang`. Consequently:

- It never sets the `ANDROID` / `ANDROID_ABI` CMake variables, so any
  `if(ANDROID_ABI)`-guarded logic silently does nothing.
- It **ignores** `-DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-28` (CMake prints it as a
  "Manually-specified variables were not used by the project" warning).
- `clang` predefines `__ANDROID_API__` from its baked-in target triple, so
  `-D__ANDROID_API__=28` would only clash with the builtin (`-Wmacro-redefined`)
  and would *not* move `__ANDROID_MIN_SDK_VERSION__`, which is what bionic's
  `__BIONIC_AVAILABILITY_GUARD(api)` actually tests.

The working fix is `add_compile_definitions(__ANDROID_UNAVAILABLE_SYMBOLS_ARE_WEAK__)`
for the Android build. That macro forces `__BIONIC_AVAILABILITY_GUARD(api)` to
`1` for every API level (declarations always visible) and makes any symbol newer
than the toolchain's baked-in min-SDK a **weak** reference resolved by the
dynamic linker at load time — present on every API-28+ device the artifact
targets. It is never compiler-predefined, so defining it is clean. The guard
detects Android via `OS_NAME MATCHES "Android"` (CI passes
`-DOS_NAME=Linux-Android`) and the compiler path, not `ANDROID_ABI`.

## OpenCL / Adreno backend on Android

A second Android arm64 artifact is built with the OpenCL backend enabled and
Adreno-tuned kernels embedded. It ships under the Maven classifier
`opencl-android-aarch64` and is consumed only when callers explicitly request it.
The default Android arm64 JAR remains CPU-only.

Three places wire it together (mirrors the CUDA classifier pattern):

1. **`llama/CMakeLists.txt`** — `elseif(GGML_OPENCL)` branch routes artifacts to
   `src/main/resources_android_opencl/net/ladenthin/llama/${OS_NAME}/${OS_ARCH}/`.
2. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — `crosscompile-android-aarch64-opencl`
   job runs the dockcross-android-arm64 build with
   `-DGGML_OPENCL=ON -DGGML_OPENCL_EMBED_KERNELS=ON -DGGML_OPENCL_USE_ADRENO_KERNELS=ON`
   and uploads as artifact `android-libraries-opencl`. The `package`,
   `publish-snapshot`, and `publish-release` jobs download it into
   `resources_android_opencl/` and activate the `opencl-android` Maven profile.
3. **`llama/pom.xml`** — the `opencl-android` profile produces a second JAR with
   `<classifier>opencl-android-aarch64</classifier>` from the
   `${project.build.outputDirectory}_opencl_android` tree.

Local sanity build:
```bash
.github/dockcross/dockcross-android-arm64 .github/build_opencl_android.sh \
  "-DOS_NAME=Linux-Android -DOS_ARCH=aarch64 \
   -DGGML_OPENCL=ON -DGGML_OPENCL_EMBED_KERNELS=ON \
   -DGGML_OPENCL_USE_ADRENO_KERNELS=ON"
```
Artifacts land in `src/main/resources_android_opencl/net/ladenthin/llama/Linux-Android/aarch64/`.

The dockcross image does not ship OpenCL headers or a stub `libOpenCL.so`, so
`build_opencl_android.sh` first stages Khronos `OpenCL-Headers` and
cross-builds `OpenCL-ICD-Loader` into `/tmp/opencl-stage/` before invoking the
main project cmake with `-DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=...` and `-DOpenCL_LIBRARY=...`.
At runtime the device must provide its own OpenCL ICD (`libOpenCL.so`);
Qualcomm Adreno drivers do. Devices without an ICD should use the default
CPU-only Android JAR.

## Windows native classifiers (default Ninja CPU + MSVC classifier + CUDA/Vulkan/OpenCL GPU)

The Windows native libraries ship in **five** forms. The **default JAR's** Windows natives are now
built with the **`Ninja Multi-Config`** generator (the *default flip*); the Visual Studio / MSVC
build is shipped as the **`msvc-windows`** classifier; and three GPU backends ship as
**`cuda13-windows-x86-64`**, **`vulkan-windows-x86-64`**, and **`opencl-windows-x86-64`** (all
**x86_64 only**, all Ninja).

**Why Ninja is the default (the flip).** The Visual Studio generator ignores
`CMAKE_{C,CXX}_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`, so only Ninja Multi-Config can front `cl.exe` with sccache over
Depot WebDAV. **Both generators use the same MSVC toolchain** (`cl.exe`, static `/MT` CRT via
`CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`, same Release flags, same runner), so the produced
`jllama.dll` binaries are **functionally equivalent with identical runtime
dependencies** — the only difference is build-system plumbing + caching. Making Ninja the default
gives the most-pulled JAR the sccache cache; MSVC stays available as a classifier for anyone who
wants the Visual-Studio-generator build. (Upstream llama.cpp also builds its Windows artifacts with
Ninja Multi-Config + MSVC.) Both Windows CPU builds are validated end-to-end with the full
model-backed Java suite (`test-java-windows-x86_64` = default/Ninja, `test-java-windows-x86_64-msvc`
= MSVC classifier).

**GPU runtime libraries are NOT bundled.** The GPU JARs ship only the single monolithic
`jllama.dll` (llama.cpp + ggml + the backend are statically linked in — `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF`). The consumer's driver/toolkit must supply the runtime: CUDA needs the
installed CUDA 13 Toolkit (`cudart64_13.dll`/`cublas64_13.dll`/`cublasLt64_13.dll` on `PATH`); Vulkan
needs `vulkan-1.dll` (ships with current GPU drivers); OpenCL needs the vendor ICD
(`System32\OpenCL.dll`). Not bundling = no NVIDIA-EULA redistribution obligation. **GitHub-hosted
Windows runners have NO GPU**, so the GPU jobs **build the artifact only** (no `-DBUILD_TESTING`/`ctest`)
— a GPU-linked `jllama_test.exe` can't even be enumerated on a GPU-less runner (it errors probing for a
device, so `gtest_discover_tests` registers a failing `*_NOT_BUILT` sentinel). The CPU-only C++ unit
suite is fully covered by the `C++ Tests` job + the CPU Windows jobs; model-backed GPU inference is
local / self-hosted.

Wiring (mirrors the CUDA-Linux / OpenCL-Android classifier pattern):

1. **`llama/CMakeLists.txt`** — the `if(GGML_CUDA) … elseif(GGML_VULKAN) … elseif(GGML_OPENCL) … else()`
   chain is **OS-aware**: CUDA → `resources_windows_cuda` on Windows (else `resources_linux_cuda`),
   Vulkan → `resources_windows_vulkan` on Windows (else `resources_linux_vulkan` — see "Linux Vulkan
   classifiers" above), OpenCL → `resources_windows_opencl` on Windows (else
   `resources_android_opencl`). The default CPU build (both generators) still emits to the canonical
   `src/main/resources/.../Windows/{x86_64,x86}/`, so the Ninja-vs-MSVC split is purely a
   CI-artifact-name + pom-profile concern (no CMake change for it).
2. **`.github/build.bat`** — the sccache probe guard (mirrors `build.sh`) wraps the **cl.exe** C/C++ TUs
   only. Unlike `build.sh` (Linux), it does **not** wrap `nvcc`: sccache on Windows can't parse the nvcc
   command line (`sccache: error: Could not parse shell line`) and fails every `.cu` compile, so CUDA
   device code builds with nvcc directly (uncached). `build.bat` also propagates a `cmake --build`
   failure as a non-zero exit (a prior bug let a failed CUDA build exit 0 → empty artifact → late
   `package` failure); the GPU upload steps additionally use `if-no-files-found: error` as a backstop.
3. **`.github/build_opencl_windows.bat`** — stages Khronos OpenCL-Headers + builds OpenCL-ICD-Loader
   (`OpenCL.lib`), then delegates to `build.bat` with `-DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR`/`-DOpenCL_LIBRARY`
   (the Windows analogue of `build_opencl_android.sh`).
4. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — build jobs (all `windows-2025-vs2026`, `ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1`,
   sccache v0.16.0 zip + Depot WebDAV):
   - `build-windows-x86_64` / `build-windows-x86` — **Ninja CPU**, artifacts `Windows-{arch}-libraries`
     → picked up by the `package` job's `pattern: "*-libraries"` into the **default** tree.
   - `build-windows-x86_64-msvc` / `build-windows-x86-msvc` — **MSVC CPU**, artifacts `Windows-{arch}-msvc`.
   - `build-windows-x86_64-cuda` — `Jimver/cuda-toolkit@v0.2.36` (CUDA `13.3.1`) + `-DGGML_CUDA=ON`,
     artifact `Windows-x86_64-cuda`.
   - `build-windows-x86_64-vulkan` — `jakoch/install-vulkan-sdk-action` + `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON`, artifact
     `Windows-x86_64-vulkan`.
   - `build-windows-x86_64-opencl` — `build_opencl_windows.bat -DGGML_OPENCL=ON -DGGML_OPENCL_EMBED_KERNELS=ON`,
     artifact `Windows-x86_64-opencl`.
   The `package`, `publish-snapshot`, and `publish-release` jobs download each non-default artifact into
   its `src/main/resources_windows_{msvc,cuda,vulkan,opencl}/` tree and activate the
   `windows-msvc,cuda-windows,vulkan-windows,opencl-windows` Maven profiles.
5. **`llama/pom.xml`** — profiles `windows-msvc` / `cuda-windows` / `vulkan-windows` / `opencl-windows`,
   each a separate compile pass + resource copy + classified jar (classifiers `msvc-windows` /
   `cuda13-windows-x86-64` / `vulkan-windows-x86-64` / `opencl-windows-x86-64`). Activated only in CI.
6. **`README.md`** — the classifier table + dependency snippets in "Choosing the right classifier".

`src/main/resources_windows_{msvc,cuda,vulkan,opencl}/` are git-ignored (staged by CI, never committed).

**First CI run (PR #276, run 28327740376):** the default Ninja CPU flip, the MSVC classifier, and the
**OpenCL** job were green on the first try. Two GPU jobs needed a toolchain fix: **CUDA** failed with
`Version not available: 13.0.0` because the pinned `Jimver/cuda-toolkit@v0.2.24` predated CUDA 13.x →
bumped to `@v0.2.35` + `13.2.0` (matches the Linux pin, classifier stays `cuda13-…`); **Vulkan** failed
`find_package(Vulkan)` because `humbletim/install-vulkan-sdk` set `VULKAN_SDK` but laid the SDK out in a
way CMake's `FindVulkan` couldn't read → switched to `jakoch/install-vulkan-sdk-action` (purpose-built,
FindVulkan-compatible). Because all five Windows build jobs are in the `package`/publish `needs:` graph, a
GPU-toolchain failure blocks packaging — the same release-gating policy the Linux-CUDA / Android-OpenCL
jobs already follow.

**Local sanity builds** (need MSVC + Ninja on PATH; sccache optional; GPU builds also need the matching SDK):
```bat
mvn -q compile
.github\build.bat -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DOS_NAME=Windows -DOS_ARCH=x86_64 -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
:: GPU (needs the matching SDK installed + on PATH):
.github\build.bat -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DGGML_CUDA=ON   -DOS_NAME=Windows -DOS_ARCH=x86_64
.github\build.bat -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DOS_NAME=Windows -DOS_ARCH=x86_64
.github\build_opencl_windows.bat -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DGGML_OPENCL=ON -DGGML_OPENCL_EMBED_KERNELS=ON -DOS_NAME=Windows -DOS_ARCH=x86_64
```

## Linux Vulkan classifiers + Windows arm64 CPU

Three additional artifacts extend the matrix toward upstream llama.cpp's release set. They follow
the same classifier/resource-tree pattern as CUDA-Linux and Vulkan-Windows.

**Linux Vulkan (`vulkan-linux-x86-64` + `vulkan-linux-aarch64`).** A vendor-neutral GPU jar for
Linux (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel) with no CUDA toolkit — the intersection of the existing Vulkan-Windows
and CUDA-Linux wiring. Four places:

1. **`llama/CMakeLists.txt`** — the `elseif(GGML_VULKAN)` branch is now **OS-aware** (mirrors
   `GGML_CUDA`): Windows → `resources_windows_vulkan`, else → `resources_linux_vulkan`
   (`.../Linux/${OS_ARCH}/`). One tree holds both arches under `Linux/{x86_64,aarch64}`.
2. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — `build-linux-x86_64-vulkan` (native `ubuntu-latest`, **not**
   dockcross — the Vulkan SDK is a trivial apt install and upstream builds ubuntu-vulkan the same way)
   and `build-linux-aarch64-vulkan` (`ubuntu-24.04-arm` + GCC 14). Both `apt-get install libvulkan-dev
   glslc glslang-tools`, build `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF`, and are **build-only** (no
   `ctest`: a Vulkan-linked `jllama_test` errors enumerating devices on a GPU-less runner — same as the
   Windows GPU jobs). Artifacts `Linux-{x86_64,aarch64}-vulkan` → both downloaded into the **one**
   `resources_linux_vulkan/` tree by `package`/`publish-*`. Glibc floor rises to the ubuntu baseline
   (like the aarch64 CPU jar); acceptable for a GPU artifact.
3. **`llama/pom.xml`** — profiles `vulkan-linux` (classifier `vulkan-linux-x86-64`) and
   `vulkan-linux-aarch64` (classifier `vulkan-linux-aarch64`). Both read the shared
   `resources_linux_vulkan` tree but the resource-copy `<includes>` is **arch-scoped**
   (`net/ladenthin/llama/Linux/{x86_64,aarch64}/**`), so each classifier JAR carries only its own
   arch (verified: each jar contains exactly one `libjllama.so`). Separate output dirs
   `_linux_vulkan` / `_linux_vulkan_aarch64` avoid collision. Activated in CI via
   `-P …,vulkan-linux,vulkan-linux-aarch64,…`.
4. **`README.md`** — classifier table + dependency snippets.

`src/main/resources_linux_vulkan/` is git-ignored (staged by CI, never committed). GPU runtime
`libvulkan.so.1` is supplied by the consumer's driver — nothing is bundled (same policy as every GPU
classifier).

**Windows arm64 CPU (default JAR, no classifier).** `build-windows-arm64` runs natively on GitHub's
free `windows-11-arm` runner (`ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd` `arch: arm64`, Ninja Multi-Config, `-DOS_ARCH=aarch64`,
build + `ctest`). It emits to the **canonical** `resources/.../Windows/aarch64/` and uploads
`Windows-aarch64-libraries`, which the `package`/`publish-*` `*-libraries` glob merges into the default
tree — so it ships in the **default** JAR alongside Windows x86-64 / x86 (like those, it is not a
classifier). No Java change was needed: `OSInfo` already maps a Windows-on-ARM JVM (`os.arch=aarch64`)
to `Windows/aarch64` (it isn't in `archMapping`, so it falls through `translateArchNameToFolderName`).
sccache is intentionally omitted (the shared install step pulls the x86_64 sccache zip; not worth an
arm64 path for one CPU job — `build.bat` just builds uncached). **Compiler: `clang-cl`, not MSVC
`cl.exe`.** ggml's `ggml-cpu/CMakeLists.txt` aborts with *"MSVC is not supported for ARM, use clang"*
via `if (MSVC AND NOT CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "Clang")`; `clang-cl` (LLVM's MSVC-compatible driver)
satisfies that guard (compiler id `"Clang"`) while keeping CMake's `MSVC=TRUE`, so the static `/MT` CRT
block still applies and the generator stays Ninja Multi-Config. The job passes
`-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl`; `msvc-dev-cmd` supplies the MSVC
headers/libs/linker **and the bundled clang-cl/lld-link** (`VC\Tools\Llvm\ARM64`), so no separate
LLVM install is needed. It also passes **`-DGGML_OPENMP=OFF`**: with clang-cl, ggml links LLVM's
OpenMP (`libomp.lib` → `libomp140.aarch64.dll` at runtime), which — unlike MSVC's ambient
`vcomp140.dll` on x64 — is not on `PATH`, so the test exe (and any consumer) failed to launch with
`0xc0000135` (`STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`). Disabling OpenMP makes ggml use its own `std::thread`
threadpool, leaving the arm64 `jllama.dll` self-contained (the x86_64/x86 jobs keep OpenMP via MSVC
`vcomp`). (Upstream llama.cpp instead cross-compiles arm64 from an
x64 runner with `vcvarsall amd64_arm64` + a `clang`/`clang++` toolchain file and no arm64 tests; the
native-runner + `clang-cl` route here keeps the `/MT` CRT and lets `ctest` run on real ARM hardware.)

## Additional GPU-backend classifiers (ROCm/HIP, SYCL, Win-arm64 OpenCL, OpenVINO)

Eight further GPU classifiers extend the matrix toward upstream llama.cpp's full release set. They
follow the **exact same 5-place wiring** as the CUDA/Vulkan classifiers (no special cases — KISS): a
`CMakeLists.txt` backend branch, a `publish.yml` build job (in `package.needs`, **fail-loud** — a
broken build reds the pipeline, same policy as every GPU job), a `pom.xml` classifier profile, a
`README.md` row, and a git-ignored `resources_*` tree. All are **build-only** (GitHub runners have no
matching GPU) and bundle **no** vendor runtime.

| Classifier | GGML flag(s) | Job runner / toolchain | Tree |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rocm-linux-x86-64` | `GGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=…` | `ubuntu-latest` + ROCm apt repo (`/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang`) | `resources_linux_rocm` |
| `rocm-windows-x86-64` | `GGML_HIP=ON` | `windows-2025-vs2026` + AMD HIP SDK | `resources_windows_rocm` |
| `sycl-fp16-linux-x86-64` | `GGML_SYCL=ON -DGGML_SYCL_F16=ON` (`icx`/`icpx`) | `ubuntu-latest` + Intel oneAPI apt | `resources_linux_sycl_fp16` |
| `sycl-fp32-linux-x86-64` | `GGML_SYCL=ON` (`icx`/`icpx`) | `ubuntu-latest` + Intel oneAPI apt | `resources_linux_sycl_fp32` |
| `sycl-windows-x86-64` | `GGML_SYCL=ON` (`icx`) | `windows-2025-vs2026` + oneAPI installer | `resources_windows_sycl` |
| `opencl-windows-aarch64` | `GGML_OPENCL=ON …ADRENO_KERNELS=ON` (clang-cl, `GGML_OPENMP=OFF`) | `windows-11-arm` (arm64 CPU job's toolchain) | `resources_windows_opencl` (arch subdir `aarch64`) |
| `openvino-linux-x86-64` | `GGML_OPENVINO=ON` | `ubuntu-latest` + OpenVINO apt | `resources_linux_openvino` |
| `openvino-windows-x86-64` | `GGML_OPENVINO=ON` | `windows-2025-vs2026` + OpenVINO archive | `resources_windows_openvino` |

Two routing notes mirror existing precedent: **Linux SYCL** ships two precision variants at the *same*
arch, so `CMakeLists.txt` routes them to two *distinct* trees by `GGML_SYCL_F16` (fp16 vs fp32).
**Windows OpenCL** now holds both `x86_64` (desktop ICD) and `aarch64` (Snapdragon/Adreno) in the one
`resources_windows_opencl` tree, split by the `opencl-windows` / `opencl-windows-aarch64` profiles'
arch-scoped `<includes>` — exactly like the `vulkan-linux` / `vulkan-linux-aarch64` split.

The vendor toolchain install steps in `publish.yml` are **first-pass** (apt repos / vendor installers
pinned to a specific version): if a URL/version 404s in CI, the job fails loud and the step is adjusted
— the failure is intentional signal, not a regression to hide behind `continue-on-error`.
`src/main/resources_{linux_rocm,windows_rocm,linux_sycl_fp16,linux_sycl_fp32,windows_sycl,linux_openvino,windows_openvino}/`
are all git-ignored (staged by CI, never committed).

## macOS arm64: three build jobs, one shipped dylib

macOS arm64 is the **only** `{OS}/{ARCH}` built by more than one job, and it has **no classifier** —
all three variants ship (or don't) into the same default-JAR path `Mac/aarch64/libjllama.dylib`:

| Job | Build flags | Artifact | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build-macos-arm64-metal-15` (macos-15) | `-DLLAMA_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=ON -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF` | `macos-15-metal` | **shipped** in the default JAR |
| `build-macos-arm64-metal` (macos-14) | `-DLLAMA_METAL_EMBED_LIBRARY=ON` (host-native) | `macos-14-metal` | test-only |
| `build-macos-arm64-no-metal` (macos-15) | `-DLLAMA_METAL=OFF -DGGML_NATIVE=OFF` | `macos-15-no-metal` | test-only |

None of the three passes `-DOS_NAME`/`-DOS_ARCH`, so `CMakeLists.txt` auto-detects the **same**
output subdirectory in all three. The shipped variant is `macos-15-metal` because it is the only one
with **both** Metal **and** `GGML_NATIVE=OFF` (portable across Apple-silicon generations); the other
two exist to prove the no-Metal path and the macos-14 SDK still build and pass the Java suite.

**The invariant: at most one `*-libraries` artifact per `{OS}/{ARCH}`.** The `package`,
`publish-snapshot` and `publish-release` jobs collect the default JAR's natives with one globbed
`actions/download-artifact` (`pattern: "*-libraries"`). An artifact *name* says nothing about which
subdirectory the job actually wrote, so two artifacts sharing a relative path get extracted onto one
file — and the survivor can be a **byte-level hybrid** of both, not either input. All three macOS
jobs used to upload under a `*-libraries` name: the published dylib's ad-hoc linker signature then no
longer matched its own `__TEXT` pages and macOS **SIGKILLed every process that loaded it** (shipped
broken in 5.0.6 and several 5.0.7 snapshots; 66/4078 and 1141/4097 code pages failed their stored
hashes). Windows already avoided this by naming its MSVC variants outside the glob; macOS now does
the same, and the shipped variant is chosen by an **explicit download step by name**, never by which
artifact name happens to match a glob.

**The guard: `.github/merge-native-artifacts.sh`.** The three consumer jobs download the glob
**unmerged** (`merge-multiple` off → one subdirectory per artifact) and let that script do the merge.
It fails the job when any relative path is claimed by more than one `*-libraries` artifact, and when
the glob matched nothing at all (a silently native-library-free default JAR). Note **why the check
runs before the merge**: a collision still leaves exactly one file on the path, so a post-merge
assertion like "exactly one dylib per `{OS}/{ARCH}`" cannot see it — the collision is only observable
while the artifacts are still separate. A future job that reopens the hole (a second job writing
`Mac/aarch64`, or a new platform whose auto-detected subdir clashes) reds the pipeline instead of
shipping a corrupt binary.

**The end-to-end gate: `smoke-fatjar-macos`.** The three macOS Java test jobs each test the dylib
*their own job* built, so until now nothing exercised the **packaged** artifact on macOS — Linux and
Windows had `smoke-fatjar-*` downstream of `package`, macOS had none, which is why this bug reached
three releases with a fully green pipeline. The job (`needs: [package]`, `macos-15`, gates both
publish jobs) downloads `llama-jars` and runs `.github/smoke-native-macos.sh`, which extracts
`Mac/aarch64/libjllama.dylib` from the **default fat jar** and asserts two things: `codesign --verify
--strict` (re-hashes the code pages against the signature's stored hashes — the direct check for a
dylib assembled from two builds) and a real JVM load via `.github/smoke/NativeLoadSmoke.java`
(`java -cp <fatjar> …`, the JDK single-file source launcher), which forces
`LlamaLoader.initialize() → System.load() → JNI_OnLoad` and then crosses JNI for
`getLlamaCppBuildInfo()`, checked against the `LlamaCppVersion` pin.

Two macOS specifics: it targets the **default** fat jar because there is no `all-macos-*` fat jar to
target (macOS has no GPU classifier — Metal is in the default jar — so `package-fatjars` builds no
macOS variant), and it asserts native loadability rather than a CLI exit code, so it cannot reuse
`smoke-test-fatjar.sh` (whose backend-manifest grep never matches the manifest-less default jar).
Deliberately model-free (~1 min, no GGUF/cache restore/network): a full model-backed macOS server
smoke would be strictly more, but this catches the failure class that actually shipped and is cheap
enough to always run. It is the macOS member of the cross-repo convention in
[`../workspace/policies/fat-jar-release-assets.md`](../workspace/policies/fat-jar-release-assets.md)
("No release asset is attached that CI has not run"), which BAF and srcmorph implement with a shared
`smoke-fatjar-cli.sh`.

## All-backends server fat jars (GitHub Release assets, never Maven Central)

Every pipeline run assembles **per-OS multi-backend server fat jars** and, on the release
paths, attaches them to GitHub: `llama-<version>-all-<os>-<arch>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
for `linux-x86-64`, `linux-aarch64`, `windows-x86-64`, `windows-aarch64`, plus the default
CPU fat jar — each with a `.sha256` **and** a detached GPG `.asc` signature. They are
**download assets only**: the Central deploy invocations run without the `assembly` profile
and are untouched. (The cross-repo "fat jar → GitHub Release, never Central, signed `.asc`"
convention shared with BAF and srcmorph is documented in
[`../workspace/policies/fat-jar-release-assets.md`](../workspace/policies/fat-jar-release-assets.md).)

Mechanism (three pieces):

1. **`.github/package-fatjars.sh`** — run by the `package-fatjars` job (`needs: [package]`,
   downloads `llama-jars`). Enumerates the `<classifier>` set from `llama/pom.xml` (source of
   truth) and cross-checks it in **both** directions against the built classifier jars; parses
   each classifier as `<backend>-<os>-<arch>`; **fails loud** on unparseable classifiers,
   backends missing from its priority table, missing native trees, or zip-update corruption
   (entry list, `Main-Class`, sample byte-compare). Excluded by design: `msvc-windows`
   (redundant CPU variant) and `opencl-android-aarch64` (no `java -jar` on Android). For each
   OS/arch it copies the default fat jar and adds every backend's native tree under
   `net/ladenthin/llama/<OS>/<ARCH>/<backend>/` plus a **`jllama-backends.txt`** manifest
   (backends in priority order `cuda13 rocm sycl-fp16 sycl-fp32 sycl vulkan opencl openvino`;
   extra tokens per line list sibling files such as openvino-windows' bundled `OpenCL.dll`).
   **A new classifier fails this script until it is consciously ranked/excluded** — that is the
   no-silent-gaps guarantee.
2. **`LlamaLoader` backend selection** — when (and only when) the manifest resource exists,
   the loader tries each backend subdirectory in order: extract into a per-backend temp subdir
   (`jllama-backend-<name>/`; backends share file names), load manifest extras first, then the
   backend's `jllama` library. A load failure (missing vendor runtime → `UnsatisfiedLinkError`)
   moves to the next backend; after the list it falls back to the default CPU natives. System
   property `net.ladenthin.llama.backend` forces one backend (fail-loud) or `default`/`cpu`.
   Jars without a manifest take the unchanged legacy path. A backend whose extra module is
   already resident from a previously failed attempt is skipped (by-name import cross-wiring).
3. **`publish.yml` wiring** — `smoke-fatjar-linux` / `smoke-fatjar-windows` run the
   `all-<os>-x86-64` jar via real `java -jar` on GPU-less runners (cached draft model,
   `--chat-template chatml`): poll `/health` to 200, assert a `/v1/chat/completions` choice,
   and require the loader's backend-selection log line. `publish-snapshot`/`publish-release`
   `need` `package-fatjars` + both smokes (fail-loud gating); `github-release-signed` and
   `github-snapshot` additionally download `llama-fatjars` into their asset directory, then
   **GPG-sign each fat jar** via `.github/sign-fatjars.sh` (a detached `.asc` alongside the
   `.sha256`), so the fat jars land signed on the tag release and the rolling `snapshot`
   pre-release. Both jobs declare `environment: maven-central` (where the signing key secret is
   scoped; it has no approval gate) and `checkout` the repo so the script is present. Signing
   happens in these attach jobs — not in `package-fatjars` — because only this dispatch-gated
   release path receives the key.

A backend loading successfully but finding **zero usable devices** (e.g. CUDA toolkit
installed, no NVIDIA GPU) is benign: ggml's backend registry contributes no devices and
inference runs on CPU inside that library. The known trade-off is that such a host never
reaches a *different* GPU backend later in the list — the `net.ladenthin.llama.backend`
override is the escape hatch (documented in the README table).

## WebUI (llama.cpp Svelte UI) embedding

The llama.cpp WebUI is **built once in CI and shared to every native build**, then
compiled into `libjllama` so the embedded server (`server-http.cpp`) can serve it.
This repo commits no build outputs, so the assets are produced per-pipeline, never
checked in (same policy as the native libs).

Pipeline (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`):

1. **`build-webui` job** (ubuntu — the *only* job that runs `npm`): resolves the
   pinned `b<nnnn>` tag from `llama/CMakeLists.txt`'s `GIT_TAG`, sparse-checks-out
   `ggml-org/llama.cpp@<tag>` `tools/ui`, runs the upstream Svelte build
   (`npm ci && npm run build`), gzips `dist/` into `dist/_gzip/` (LLAMA_UI_GZIP
   parity), then runs upstream's own **`scripts/ui-assets.cmake`** (a plain `cmake -P`
   script, **no npm and no host executable**) to produce the platform-independent
   **`webui-generated/ui.cpp` + `ui.h`**, uploaded as the `webui-generated` artifact.
   Upstream **#28445** deleted the `tools/ui/embed.cpp` host tool this job used to
   compile and replaced it with that script plus `ui.cpp.in`/`ui.h.in` templates; the
   job passes `BUILD_UI=OFF HF_ENABLED=OFF` so the script takes its priority-1 path
   ("pre-built assets in `<UI_SOURCE_DIR>/dist`") over the tree npm just built — no
   second npm run, no Hugging Face download. `LLAMA_UI_GZIP` is upstream's own knob
   and replaced the job's hand-rolled gzip loop. The sparse checkout therefore needs
   **`scripts` as well as `tools/ui`**. **The completeness guard cannot be a bare
   `grep LLAMA_UI_HAS_ASSETS`**: `ui.h.in` emits `/* #undef LLAMA_UI_HAS_ASSETS */`
   for an empty table, so that token is present either way and the check passes the
   failure case — the old `embed.cpp` emitted no such line, which is why the naive
   grep used to work. The job asserts the **active** `#define` plus a non-zero count
   parsed out of `std::array<llama_ui_asset, N>`.
2. **Every native build job** (`needs: [startgate, build-webui]`) downloads that
   artifact into `webui-generated/` before building. npm never runs in the dockcross
   cross-compilers (which have no node) or per-platform.
3. **CMake** (the "WebUI assets" block in `CMakeLists.txt`): if
   `webui-generated/ui.cpp` + `ui.h` exist, compiles `ui.cpp` in and adds its dir to
   the include path — the generated `ui.h` `#define`s `LLAMA_UI_HAS_ASSETS`, which
   activates `server-http.cpp`'s static-asset routes. If absent, it falls back to the
   empty-asset stub `src/main/cpp/webui_stub/ui.h` (no embedded UI) so local builds —
   and any job without the artifact — still build and run.

The WebUI version **auto-follows** the pinned `GIT_TAG`: a llama.cpp version bump
needs no extra step here, `build-webui` re-reads the tag and rebuilds the matching UI.

**Building the WebUI locally** (optional — a plain `cmake` build uses the stub and
ships no UI):
```bash
# needs node/npm + network for the asset build; the embed step is plain cmake -P
git clone --depth 1 --branch b10909 https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp /tmp/lc
( cd /tmp/lc/tools/ui && npm ci && npm run build )
mkdir -p webui-generated /tmp/ui-gen
cmake -DUI_SOURCE_DIR=/tmp/lc/tools/ui -DUI_BINARY_DIR=/tmp/ui-gen \
      -DLLAMA_SOURCE_DIR=/tmp/lc -DBUILD_UI=OFF -DHF_ENABLED=OFF -DLLAMA_UI_GZIP=ON \
      -P /tmp/lc/scripts/ui-assets.cmake
cp /tmp/ui-gen/ui.cpp /tmp/ui-gen/ui.h webui-generated/
cmake -B build && cmake --build build --target jllama   # now embeds the real UI
```
`webui-generated/` is git-ignored.

## CI build cache & parallelism (sccache + Depot)

The native build dominates CI time (134 llama.cpp model TUs + ggml + the 16.6k-line
`httplib.cpp`, all at `-O3`). Two knobs in **`.github/build.sh`**, both behind the
`use_cache` `workflow_dispatch` input (default **true**), keep it fast and stop the macOS
runners OOM-ing.

**`BUILD_JOBS` — compile parallelism.** `build.sh` builds with `cmake --build -j${BUILD_JOBS}`
(default: all cores, via portable `nproc` → `sysctl -n hw.ncpu` → `4` detection). GitHub's
~7 GB **macOS arm64** runners OOM under full `-j` when `httplib.cpp` co-schedules with the
model TUs; the runner is then killed as **SIGTERM / exit 143** ("received a shutdown
signal"), which *looks* like a timeout but is an out-of-memory kill. The three macOS build
jobs therefore set `BUILD_JOBS: 2` to bound peak memory.

**`sccache` → Depot Cache — shared compiler cache.** When `USE_CACHE=true` **and** `sccache`
plus a cache token are present, `build.sh` adds
`-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` and prints
`sccache --show-stats`. **Per-job cache summary:** when running in CI (`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` set),
`build.sh`/`build.bat` also parse those stats and append a small `### sccache statistics` table
(`Cache hits | Requests | Hit rate`) to the job summary — the sccache/Depot analogue of upstream
llama.cpp's `ccache-action` "CCache Statistics" table, per-job (GitHub does not merge job
summaries). It is best-effort (skipped silently if the numbers can't be parsed) and only emitted
when sccache was actually the launcher; local runs (no `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`) are untouched. The
cache lives in **Depot Cache** over sccache's **WebDAV** backend:

- `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT: https://cache.depot.dev`
- `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}` — a Depot **organization** token, stored
  as the repo secret **`DEPOT_TOKEN`**.

Because `sccache` is **content-addressed** and llama.cpp is pinned (`GIT_TAG b10909`), the
~280 upstream object files are byte-identical every run, so a warm cache recompiles only the
*changed* files. Depot's cache is **shared across all branches** (unlike GitHub's
per-branch `actions/cache`), so every branch builds incrementally; a `b<nnnn>` version bump
naturally invalidates the upstream entries (their content changed) with no manual step. It
stays `-O3` and is **bit-identical** to a clean build (release-safe).

**Safety / transparency.** It is **inert** until `DEPOT_TOKEN` is configured and on **fork
PRs** (secrets are hidden there) — those simply compile normally; the `Install sccache` step
is `continue-on-error`; and `use_cache=false` forces a pristine, from-scratch build. Crucially,
`build.sh` runs a **probe-compile health-check** (`sccache_can_wrap_compiler`) before trusting
sccache as the launcher: it compiles a trivial TU *through* sccache, and only sets
`-DCMAKE_{C,CXX}_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache` if that succeeds. So a sccache that is present but
**crashes** (the in-container panic that stalled phase 2) also falls back to an uncached, green
`-O3` build — it logs the Rust panic backtrace (and the detached server's `SCCACHE_ERROR_LOG`,
when a job sets one) for diagnosis but never reds the build. This closes the gap the original
absent-only guard left.

**The fork-PR `.sccache_check` 403 (mac-only symptom) and its two guards.** A fork PR (e.g.
`vaiju1981/java-llama.cpp` → upstream) runs with secrets withheld, so `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_TOKEN`
(`= secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN`) is **empty**. Depot rejects the unauthenticated server-startup
`.sccache_check` with **403 Forbidden** (`PermissionDenied (temporary) … Forbidden`), and
because sccache treats a failed startup check as fatal, *every* TU dies. The symptom looked
**mac-only** purely because of an asymmetry in how sccache reaches `PATH`: the macOS jobs ran
`brew install sccache` **unconditionally** (`if: USE_CACHE == 'true'`), whereas the
Linux/dockcross/aarch64 jobs only **fetch** sccache when a token is present (the `[ -n
"$SCCACHE_WEBDAV_TOKEN…" ]` guard in `build.sh`'s fetch block) — so on a tokenless fork PR
mac was the only platform with sccache on `PATH` to misfire. Two independent guards now prevent
it: **(1)** every `Install sccache` step is gated `if: env.USE_CACHE == 'true' && env.SCCACHE_WEBDAV_TOKEN
!= ''`, so a tokenless fork PR never even installs sccache (mac now matches Linux); and **(2)**
`build.sh`'s build step **retries once without the launcher** when the build fails *and* the
output shows an sccache cache error (`sccache: error` / `Server startup failed` / `cache storage
failed`) — a clean uncached `-O3` rebuild that is content-identical and release-safe. The retry
is gated on that error signature so a genuine compile error still fails fast and is reported
(no wasteful uncached rebuild). Guard (2) also covers an *intermittent* 403 that strikes a
valid-token job mid-build, which the one-shot probe cannot foresee.

**Rollout.** **Phase 1 — DONE & proven: the 3 macOS build jobs** (slowest + OOM-prone) —
`brew install sccache` + the env above + `BUILD_JOBS: 2`. macOS build dropped **~40 min → ~6 min**
with a warm cache. **Phase 2 — DONE: all 5 dockcross cross-compile jobs** now have the same
steady-state env (`USE_CACHE` + `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_*` + `DOCKCROSS_ARGS`). The probe makes it safe
to enable them all at once — any container where sccache crashes falls back to an uncached green
build automatically. (The first attempt enabled all four at once without the probe and was
reverted: the static-musl sccache v0.8.2 panicked in-container and redded the build. With
v0.16.0 + the probe this is no longer a risk.) Job-by-job status:
1. `crosscompile-linux-x86_64` (manylinux2014) — ✅ **verified green** in PR #245: sccache
   **v0.16.0** probe passed in-container (devtoolset-10 gcc), `sccache ON` over Depot WebDAV,
   warm cache 277/278 hits (99.64%), 1m46s build time.
2. `crosscompile-linux-x86_64-cuda` (via `build_cuda_linux.sh`, which execs `build.sh`) —
   ✅ **verified green with nvcc caching, full-arch always.** `build.sh` also wraps nvcc
   (`-DCMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=sccache`, scoped to CUDA builds), so both the gcc C/C++ TUs
   (134 model files + ggml + httplib) **and** the per-arch `.cu` device passes cache over Depot.
   CI dropped the single-arch validation shortcut (`CUDA_FAST_BUILD`/`CUDA_ARCH` removed from the
   job) — every run builds the full arch set and leans on the warm cache for speed. A warm run hit
   **100%** on CUDA / CUBIN / device-code (139 CUDA hits, 99.86% overall, 3 misses), cutting the job
   from **~51 min cold to ~15 min warm**. The first-run debug diagnostics (`SCCACHE_LOG` /
   `SCCACHE_ERROR_LOG` / `RUST_BACKTRACE`) were dropped once confirmed; `sccache --show-stats` still
   prints the hit table every run. **CUDA 13.3 regression (caught on the b10333/CUDA-13.3 publish
   dispatch, run 31339594933):** nvcc 13.3's device-compile pipeline broke sccache's nvcc wrapping —
   `fatbinary fatal: Could not open input file 'acc.compute_75.ptx'` immediately followed by
   `sccache: Compiler killed by signal 1`, on the very first `.cu` TU (a cold-cache miss, not a hit
   issue) — an sccache/nvcc incompatibility for `-virtual` architecture targets (e.g. `75-virtual`),
   not a real compile error. **Two fixes were needed, not one.** (1) The existing mid-build
   retry-without-cache mechanism (see below) didn't catch it because its trigger regex didn't include
   this failure's wording; `build.sh`'s regex now also matches `Compiler killed by signal`. (2) That
   alone still wasn't enough — verified live on the very next dispatch (run 31340386884): the retry
   fired but failed **identically**, because ggml's own `ggml/src/CMakeLists.txt` self-enables
   ccache/sccache (`GGML_CCACHE`, default `ON`) whenever it finds one on `PATH` and
   `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`/`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` are unset — exactly the retry's state,
   since sccache is still on `PATH` from the failed attempt (build.sh only clears its own `$LAUNCH`
   flags, not ggml's independent detection). ggml wires itself in via the **global**
   `RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE` CMake property, which wraps nvcc too, not just C/C++ — so the "uncached"
   retry silently re-enabled the very launcher it was trying to avoid. Fix: the retry's `cmake
   -Bbuild` now also passes `-DGGML_CCACHE=OFF`, so a genuinely uncached build is guaranteed
   regardless of what's left on `PATH`. This fallback now falls back to a real, green `-O3` build
   like every other sccache/nvcc incompatibility instead of redding the job.
3. `crosscompile-linux-aarch64` — ✅ **enabled**, now a **native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` build** (not
   dockcross): `build.sh` self-fetches the aarch64 static-musl sccache (the fetch block in
   `build.sh` maps `uname -m` → `x86_64`/`aarch64`) and the probe guards it. See "Linux aarch64:
   native ARM build" below for why it moved off the cross-compiler.
4. `crosscompile-android-aarch64` — ✅ **enabled** (same steady-state env; probe guards it).
5. `crosscompile-android-aarch64-opencl` — ✅ **enabled**. `build_opencl_android.sh` stages the
   OpenCL headers/loader, then delegates the jllama cmake build to `build.sh` via `exec`
   (same pattern as `build_cuda_linux.sh`), so it inherits the probe and launcher automatically.

Per-job recipe: add `env:` { `USE_CACHE`, `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT`, `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_TOKEN` } and
`DOCKCROSS_ARGS: "-e SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT -e SCCACHE_WEBDAV_TOKEN -e USE_CACHE"` — the
dockcross wrapper only forwards host env it is explicitly told to via `-e`. The fetched sccache
version is the `SCCACHE_DL_VERSION` knob in `build.sh` (default **0.16.0**; overridable per-job
to try a different build against a container that crashed another). **Windows** is handled
separately (the Visual Studio generator ignores `CMAKE_*_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`): see
"Windows native classifiers" below — the **default** Windows CPU JAR now uses the **Ninja
Multi-Config** generator (so it caches) with a `build.bat` sccache probe and a direct sccache zip
download (not `mozilla-actions/sccache-action`); the uncached MSVC build ships as the `msvc-windows`
classifier, and the three Windows GPU classifiers (CUDA/Vulkan/OpenCL) use the same Ninja path.

**Cross-repo scope.** This Depot/sccache compiler cache makes sense only for java-llama.cpp —
it is the only sibling repo with a native (C++/JNI) build. It does not apply to the pure-Maven
siblings; why (and why the `DEPOT_TOKEN` org secret and the README "Build cache by Depot" badge
are kept jllama-only) is explained in the cross-repo status under "Deliberate non-parity":
[`../workspace/crossrepostatus.md`](../workspace/crossrepostatus.md).

## Wire-name registries (CLI options, request keys, trainer keys)

Three surfaces leave this library as names on a wire, and each is checked against the code that reads
them. The names are **enum constants**, not string literals, and each declares the contract it must
satisfy:

| Registry | Receiver it is checked against | Contract kinds | Guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| `args.ModelFlag` + `args.ModelOption` | `common_params_parser_init(params, LLAMA_EXAMPLE_SERVER).options` | `SERVER_PARSER`, `PROJECT_PSEUDO` | `src/test/cpp/test_model_flags.cpp` |
| `parameters.RequestField` | `server_schema::make_llama_cmpl_schema(...)` | `SCHEMA`, `OAI_LAYER` | `src/test/cpp/test_wire_contracts.cpp` |
| `parameters.TrainingField` | `jllama_train::config_keys()` (`train_engine.h`) | — | `src/test/cpp/test_wire_contracts.cpp` |

`cmake/extract-java-wire-names.cmake` reads the registry `.java` files at configure time and emits
`{name, contract}` pairs into generated headers; the C++ tests feed them to the receivers. It matches
**enum constant declarations only**, so prose and javadoc cannot contribute a name, and it fails the
configure when a registry declares a name twice or extracts implausibly few. For `OAI_LAYER` keys —
which by definition never reach the schema — it additionally sweeps upstream's own sources
(`tools/server/*.cpp` + `common/*.cpp`, globbed) for a *reader shape* (`json_value(x, "k", …)`,
`.contains("k")`, `.at("k")`) and emits the hit count, because the schema cannot vouch for them.

**Why the failure modes differ, and why all three need a guard.** An unregistered CLI option is a hard
parse error — `loadModel()` throws `"Failed to parse model parameters"`, so the model does not load.
The other two are worse: llama.cpp's request schema discards an unknown key without a word, and
`train_engine.cpp` reads with `j.value(key, default)`, so a dead field simply stops having an effect.
Either way a Java test asserting the string mapping (`hasKey("--mlock")`) passes forever.

**Rules when touching a registry:**

1. **Adding a name** means adding a constant with its contract. There is no `put(String, ...)` to
   bypass — that is the point.
2. **A name with no counterpart is deleted, never deprecated.** A method that writes a key the
   receiver discards reads as configuration and behaves as a no-op.
3. **The exemption checks are inverted on purpose.** A `PROJECT_PSEUDO` / `OAI_LAYER` name cannot go
   stale by outliving its constant. It *can* go stale the other way — upstream may later register a
   name we exempted, hiding a real check — so the tests assert such a name is still unknown to the
   receiver, and that the exempt set is non-empty (a generator that lost the contract column would
   otherwise exempt everything).
4. **An `OAI_LAYER` name must additionally be read by *something* upstream.** Absence from the schema
   is satisfied just as well by a key nothing reads at all, so the inverted check alone left a hole
   the exact size of the problem — `chat_template` sat in it, written by a public builder method and
   read by nobody (upstream's only occurrence of that name is the `/props` payload it *emits*). The
   reader sweep above closes it. It is a source pattern, not the parser: it proves a key is read from
   some body, not that this endpoint reads it. That is enough for the failure that occurred, a count
   of zero.
5. **`WireNameRegistryTest` checks the other direction**: every declared constant must be reachable
   from some public builder method (driven reflectively), names are unique across both CLI
   registries, and every `OCP_OVERLY_CONCRETE_PARAMETER` suppression still names a real enum-valued
   setter.

`JsonParameters` additionally enforces that **every stored value is exactly one well-formed JSON
value**, checked on write. That is what stops a caller-supplied fragment
(`withJsonSchema`/`withResponseFormat`/`withStreamOptions`/`withMessagesJson`/`withToolsJson`) from
injecting sibling fields into a request body — a demonstrated defect, with duplicate keys resolving
last-wins in the native parser. Note `FAIL_ON_TRAILING_TOKENS` is load-bearing: plain `readTree`
parses the first value and ignores the rest, which would silently truncate such a fragment instead of
rejecting it.

The full record — which names were dead when, the fork-point archaeology, and the injection
reproducer — is in
[`docs/history/parameter-wire-surface.md`](docs/history/parameter-wire-surface.md).

## Local llama.cpp source patches (`patches/`)

The fetched llama.cpp source is patched before it compiles, via a generic mechanism:

- **`llama/patches/`** — drop any number of `*.patch` / `*.diff` files here. They are applied
  in **filename order** (use a numeric prefix, e.g. `0001-`, `0002-`), so keep them independent or
  ordered. Each must be a `git apply`-compatible unified diff with paths relative to the llama.cpp
  source root (`a/common/arg.cpp` / `b/common/arg.cpp`, i.e. `-p1`).
- **`llama/cmake/apply-llama-patches.cmake`** — the applier. Cross-platform (`cmake -P`, so identical on
  Linux/macOS/Windows), **idempotent** and **fail-loud** (a patch that no longer applies aborts the
  configure — a stale patch can't be silently dropped from a release build). Idempotency comes from
  a **stamp file** (`<llama.cpp-src>/.jllama-patches-applied`, recording the checked-out llama.cpp
  commit plus each patch's SHA-256) combined with git's clean/dirty state, not from per-patch
  probing: a **clean** source tree means nothing is applied yet (fresh fetch, or a re-checkout after
  a version bump) so everything is applied forward and the stamp written; a **dirty** tree is
  already patched, and the reconfigure is a no-op when the stamp matches this exact commit + patch
  set, or aborts with a "configure into a fresh build directory" message when it does not.
  A per-patch `git apply --reverse --check` cannot do this — `--check` never mutates the tree, so an
  earlier patch whose region a later one rewrote (`0001` vs `0006`/`0007` in
  `tools/server/server.cpp`) always reverse-checks as "not applied", and the forward re-apply then
  aborted every reconfigure of an existing build dir with a misleading "does not apply cleanly".
  A source tree supplied via `-DFETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_LLAMA.CPP=<path>` that is not a git work
  tree has neither oracle and falls back to the old per-patch path (same caveat as before).
- **`llama/CMakeLists.txt`** — wired as the llama.cpp `FetchContent_Declare(... PATCH_COMMAND ...)`, so it
  runs for **every** C++ build (all CI jobs *and* local `cmake -B build`) from one place — no
  per-build-step plumbing.

**On a llama.cpp version bump, every patch must still apply** — if a bump shifts the patched code,
the configure fails with an "does not apply cleanly" error; refresh the diff against the new source
and recommit. Treat `patches/` as part of the upgrade checklist below.

Current patches:

| Patch | Fixes |
|-------|-------|
| `0001-win32-arg-parse-embed-guard.patch` | Windows JNI regression from llama.cpp **#24779** (introduced b9739): on Windows `common_params_parse` re-derived argv from the **process** command line (`GetCommandLineW`) and adopted it, so an embedded/JNI caller (`java.exe`) lost its `--model …` args → "Failed to parse model parameters". b9789 narrowed the unconditional override to a **count-guard** (`if (static_cast<int>(utf8.buf.size()) == argc) { argv = utf8.ptrs.data(); }`), but that is exactly the variant the project already found breaks its Windows server-integration tests (when the embedded argv length coincides with `java.exe`'s). The patch carries the **complete upstream change** (so it can be submitted to llama.cpp verbatim and then dropped here): **(1)** `common_params_parse` parses **exactly the argv it is given** (no `GetCommandLineW` magic) and a new `common_params_parse_main()` wrapper holds the UTF-8 recovery for the standalone tools' `main()` (`common/arg.{cpp,h}`); **(2)** the **~34 standalone `main()` call sites** (every `common_params_parse(argc, argv, …)` across `tools/*`, `examples/*` and the `tests/*` programs) flip to `common_params_parse_main()`; **(3)** a `tests/test-arg-parser.cpp` regression case pins that `common_params_parse` honors a caller-supplied argv. The embedded caller (`jllama.cpp`) keeps calling `common_params_parse` and is never overridden. **Our subproject build compiles only the `arg.{cpp,h}` core** — `LLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS`/`LLAMA_BUILD_TESTS` are OFF for a FetchContent subproject — so the flips + test are applied-but-not-compiled here; they were validated via a one-off `-DLLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS=ON -DLLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=ON` build (the new test compiles and its asserts pass; `test-arg-parser`'s only red there is the live `ggml.ai` download check, which is sandbox-network, not the patch). Because it spans **36 files** it must be refreshed on every llama.cpp bump (the applier fails loud). **Refreshed at the b10679 bump:** upstream rewrote `tests/test-save-load-state.cpp`'s `main()` to take a `--models DIR` option, which it strips itself into a `filtered_argv` before calling `common_params_parse(fargc, filtered_argv.data(), …)`. That call site therefore stopped qualifying for the `_main()` flip — by this patch's own rule a caller that builds its own argv must use `common_params_parse` directly, so its argv is kept — and the hunk was **dropped** rather than refreshed (37 → 36 files). Caveat for whoever submits this upstream: that `main()` now filters a possibly-mojibake Windows argv *before* any UTF-8 recovery, so the fully correct upstream form there is recover-then-filter, not a one-line flip. It is out of scope for the downstream carry because `LLAMA_BUILD_TESTS` is OFF here, so the file is never compiled. **Still required at b10679, verified rather than assumed:** `common_params_parse` in pristine `b10679:common/arg.cpp` still carries the `#ifdef _WIN32` count-guarded `argv = utf8.ptrs.data()` override, and `common_params_parse_main` appears nowhere in `b10679:common/arg.h` — upstream has not adopted the fix. The upstream-facing write-up, including a standalone reproducer that makes llama.cpp's own `test-arg-parser` fail on unmodified `master`, lives in [docs/upstream-investigation-win32-argv-substitution.md](docs/upstream-investigation-win32-argv-substitution.md). **Reported upstream as [ggml-org/llama.cpp#26416](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/26416)** (2026-08-01, label `bug-unconfirmed`, first bad commit `508a475`); the issue asks which of the two directions the maintainers prefer before a PR is opened, so this patch stays downstream until they answer. |
| `0002-server-preserve-caller-load-progress-callback.patch` | Load-progress-callback regression introduced in llama.cpp **b9789**: `server_context::load_model` (`tools/server/server-context.cpp`) now **unconditionally** installs the server's own load-progress reporter on `params_base.load_progress_callback` immediately before `common_init_from_params`, clobbering any callback the embedding caller already set. libjllama's `LoadProgressCallback` feature wires `common_params.load_progress_callback` to a JNI trampoline *before* calling `load_model`, so the bump silently killed it — `LoadProgressCallbackTest` saw zero progress updates and the abort-on-`false` path never threw. The patch guards the assignment with `if (params_base.load_progress_callback == nullptr)`, so the server installs its own reporter **only when the caller hasn't** — a caller-supplied callback survives and fires during load. Standalone `llama-server` (no caller callback, so the field is null) is unaffected. Same JNI-vs-standalone divergence class as `0001`. **The guard is `== nullptr || == load_progress_callback`, and the second disjunct must never be dropped:** `load_progress_text` is a **local** of `load_model()`, and upstream re-assigns both fields on every call so the `user_data` always points at the current frame. `load_model()` runs a **second** time when resuming from the sleeping state (`--sleep-idle-seconds`), and by then `params_base` holds *our own* callback from the first load — a bare nullptr check skips the re-assignment and leaves `user_data` pointing into a **dead stack frame**, which segfaults inside `load_progress_callback()` on the first request after an idle window. That was a latent defect in this patch from the day it was written; only a second `load_model()` can reach it, and nothing exercised sleep until `IdleSleepWakeIntegrationTest` was added. |
| `0003-pr22393-server-add-slot-prompt-similarity-getter-setter.patch` | **Upstream-PR carry** of [ggml-org/llama.cpp#22393](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/22393) ("server : add slot_prompt_similarity getter/setter"). Purely additive: adds `server_context::get_slot_prompt_similarity()` / `set_slot_prompt_similarity(float)` (`tools/server/server-context.{cpp,h}`) so an embedding/JNI caller can query and tune the slot-selection threshold at runtime without reloading the model. Verbatim copy of the PR, which **upstream closed without merging** (rejected as exposing unsafe internal state — see the patch header). Carried permanently; it will not be droppable via a version bump. |
| `0007-server-attach-http-frontend.patch` | **Adds `llama_server_attach(argc, argv, server_context&)`** so the `NativeServer` *attach mode* can serve an **already-loaded `LlamaModel`** over the upstream HTTP frontend — no second model load, no `start_loop()`; the LlamaModel's worker keeps driving the shared `server_context` and the HTTP routes post tasks to its queue (the queue is the synchronization point). Mechanically: (1) extracts the **pure core route table** (`health` … `slots`) out of `llama_server()` into `static void llama_server_register_common_routes(ctx_http, routes)` (shared, so the two entry points cannot drift on the core endpoint set). **Scope note (narrowed at the b10154 bump):** the helper deliberately carries **only** the stable, state-independent route table — **not** the resumable-streaming routes (their handlers differ between router / non-router), the GCP-compat shim, or the experimental **CORS-proxy / MCP-server / built-in-tools** wiring. b10154 (upstream MCP-server support) moved the streaming routes into the middle of that block and coupled tools/CORS to a per-call `server_mcp mcp_mgr` lifecycle, so the earlier contiguous "route-table + CORS-proxy + tools" extraction is no longer possible; `llama_server()` keeps all of that inline, **byte-identical to upstream b10154** (only the route-table block is factored out). (2) adds `llama_server_attach`, which parses only the HTTP-side argv via `common_params_parse`, starts the stream-session GC + `server_http_context`, registers the common route table, the **non-router** resumable-streaming handlers (upstream b10154 paths `/v1/stream` GET/DEL + `/v1/streams/lookup` POST), the GCP-compat shim, and **403 "disabled" stubs for `/cors-proxy` + `/tools`** (attach mode does not wire the experimental CORS-proxy / MCP / built-in-tools host — those belong to a full `llama-server`, not an embedded model), marks ready immediately (model already loaded), and blocks on the HTTP thread until `llama_server_request_shutdown()` — never calling `common_init()`, backend init, `ctx_server.terminate()` or `llama_backend_free()` (the embedding caller owns those). Applies after `0001`+`0006` (same file); closes the "NativeServer — reuse an already-loaded LlamaModel" TODO. Upstream-submittable ("server: let embedding callers attach the HTTP frontend to an existing server_context"). **Refreshed at the b10519 bump:** upstream #26347 dropped the API key from the `/models` + `/v1/models` public-endpoint set and deleted the two trailing `// public endpoint (no API key check)` comments on those route registrations. Those two lines sit inside this patch's route-table removal block, so `git apply` failed ("patch does not apply", `server.cpp:258`) at **every** tag from b10519 on; the fix was to drop the now-wrong comment from all four affected lines (2 on the `-` side, 2 in the extracted helper on the `+` side), keeping the helper byte-identical to the block it replaces. **This is the invariant to re-check on every bump:** the `+` side of `llama_server_register_common_routes()` must stay a verbatim copy of the route table it factors out of `llama_server()`. |
| `0008-server-models-worker-cmd-override.patch` | **Makes router mode usable in-JVM.** The router (`server-models.cpp`) spawns each model worker by re-executing its own binary (`get_server_exec_path()` = `/proc/self/exe` & friends) — inside a JVM that binary is `java`, not a llama-server, so embedded router workers could never start. The patch adds env `LLAMA_SERVER_WORKER_CMD` (whitespace-split; read in `server_model_meta::update_args`) which replaces only the leading binary-path token of the rendered worker args, letting an embedding host relaunch workers through its own bootstrap — e.g. `java -cp app.jar net.ladenthin.llama.server.NativeServer` (each worker is then a fresh JVM running the classic single-model `NativeServer`). Exposed in Java as `NativeServer.setWorkerCommand(String...)` (JNI `setenv`); exercised by `RouterModeIntegrationTest` (Linux CI). Upstream-submittable (also useful for containerized/wrapped deployments). |
| `0010-server-cast-vocab-type-for-common-json.patch` | **Upstream regression from the b10585 `common_json` switch (#27511), one line.** `get_res_model_info()` (`tools/server/server-context.cpp`) builds the `GET /models` + `GET /v1/models` payload and emits `{"vocab_type", meta.model_vocab_type}` — an **unscoped enum**. `common_json_value`'s integral constructor template is `std::is_integral`-gated, which *excludes* enums, so the value binds to `common_json_value(bool)` and serialises as `true`/`false` instead of the numeric vocab type. It was correct while the alias was `nlohmann::ordered_json` (nlohmann serialises an enum as an integer), so upstream regressed it silently when they flipped the alias. The project ships this: `server-context.cpp` is compiled into `libjllama` and both routes are served by `NativeServer` — the default fat-jar `Main-Class` — in full **and** attach mode (`patches/0007`'s common route table registers them). The patch casts the value to `int` at the emit site, mirroring what `jllama.cpp` does for its own two `"vocab_type"` sites. Upstream-submittable; **not yet filed upstream**. Applies after `0002`/`0003` (same file) — numbered `0010` because `0009` is burned: it names the subprocess.h patch dropped at the b10280 bump (see the note below this table), and reusing the number would make that note read as if it were about this patch. **On every bump, check whether upstream cast the value themselves; if they did, DROP this patch rather than refreshing it** — the fail-loud applier only detects "does not apply", never "upstream already fixed this", and no test can catch a redundant carry here because `get_res_model_info` is `static` inside `server-context.cpp` and unreachable from `jllama_test`. See the `CommonJsonEnumTrap` tests in `test_json_helpers.cpp` for the mechanism the cast defends against. |
| `0011-peg-parser-lenient-invalid-utf8.patch` | **A model that emits one malformed UTF-8 byte turns a finished generation into an HTTP 500.** The server parses *every* completion through `common_chat_parse()`; with no chat parser configured (plain `/completion`) that is the content-only fallback `content(rest()) + end()`, whose scan is `common_peg_until_parser` (`common/peg-parser.cpp`). `common_chat_peg_parse()` always parses in **lenient** mode, and that scan tolerates an `INCOMPLETE` trailing UTF-8 sequence by keeping the text before it — but the `INVALID` branch right below it returns `FAIL` unconditionally, ignoring leniency. One stray byte anywhere in the generated text therefore throws `"The model produced output that does not match the expected Content-only format"` and the request 500s even though generation completed normally (`stop processing: n_tokens = 4, truncated = 0`). The patch makes the `INVALID` branch respect `ctx.is_lenient()` exactly like the `INCOMPLETE` branch — keep the text up to the malformed byte — and adds an upstream `tests/peg-parser/test-unicode.cpp` case pinning both the lenient and the still-failing strict behavior. **Strict mode is unchanged**, which is what keeps upstream's own tests green: `tests/peg-parser/test-unicode.cpp` *does* assert `FAIL` on invalid UTF-8 through the *until* parser (a `malformed UTF-8` block with three `p.until("</tag>")` cases), but each builds a bare `common_peg_parse_context` with no `COMMON_PEG_PARSE_FLAG_LENIENT`, so the lenient-only change cannot reach them. This patch adds its case inside that same block. Found by `NativeServerAttachIntegrationTest.completion_overHttp_served`, which 500s on all six Java CI platforms. Upstream-submittable; **not yet filed upstream**. Touches only `common/peg-parser.cpp` + that test, which no other patch touches, so it is independent of `0001`/`0006`/`0007`. Runnable guard: the `ContentOnlyParseUtf8` tests in `src/test/cpp/test_utils.cpp` — unlike the upstream test they are compiled and run in CI on every platform, so a bump that drops this patch reds `C++ Tests` instead of one Java job. |
| `0006-server-embed-native-server-jni.patch` | **Makes `server.cpp`'s `llama_server` embeddable in the JVM** so the `NativeServer` JNI bridge can run the full upstream HTTP server (WebUI included) inside `libjllama` — see "Two server modes" below. b9870 already exposes `int llama_server(int, char**)` (non-static; no `main` in the file), so the patch only adds embedded-mode support: (1) a `g_llama_server_embedded` flag + `llama_server_set_embedded()` / `llama_server_request_shutdown()` (declared in the committed `src/main/cpp/native_server_bridge.h`); (2) skips installing the process-wide SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers when embedded (they would hijack the JVM's); (3) in embedded mode parses the **forwarded** argv via `common_params_parse` instead of `common_params_parse_main` (whose `GetCommandLineW` recovery would pick up `java.exe`'s command line — the same Windows class of bug `0001` fixes). `llama_server_request_shutdown()` mirrors the SIGTERM path (invokes the installed `shutdown_handler` → `ctx_server.terminate()` unblocks `start_loop()`), giving JNI an out-of-band stop since `ctx_server` is loop-local. Applies **after `0001`** (which flips this call site to `common_params_parse_main`), so its context is the post-`0001` tree; regenerate against `0001`+source on a bump. Only touches `tools/server/server.cpp`. |
| `0012-model-guard-zero-split-sum-and-name-the-device-index.patch` | **A GPU that reports zero free memory makes every model load fail with the unactionable `error loading model: vector`.** `llama_model_base::load_tensors` (`src/llama-model.cpp`) weights the per-device layer split by `ggml_backend_dev_memory()`'s `free`, then normalises: `splits[i] /= split_sum`. With a single device reporting `free == 0` that is `0/0` → **NaN** in every split point; NaN compares false against everything, so the `std::upper_bound` below returns the end iterator, `layer_gpu == n_devices()`, and `devices.at(layer_gpu)` throws `std::out_of_range` — whose libc++ `what()` is the bare string `"vector"`, which `llama.cpp`'s `catch (const std::exception &)` prints verbatim. Upstream's `free == 0 && total == 0` host-memory fallback does **not** fire, because `total` is `recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize` and is non-zero. **Reachable since b10618..b10797**: upstream `8c0b9cd04` ("metal : fix memory query under low-memory conditions", [#27701](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/27701)) changed `ggml-metal-device.m` to `*free = *total > cur ? *total - cur : 0`; before that clamp an over-committed device (`currentAllocatedSize > recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`) *underflowed* to a huge `size_t`, which normalised fine, so the same precondition was harmless. That is why the `Java Tests macOS …` jobs went red at the b10792→b10797 step while every Linux/Windows job stayed green — **and why only a GPU build can fail this way at all**: `act_gpu_layers` is `devices.empty() ? 0 : …`, so with no GPU backend `devices` is empty, every layer returns early on `cpu_dev`, and the `.at()` line is unreachable. **Shape:** the two blocks are lifted out of `load_tensors` into free functions declared in `src/llama-model.h`, purely so they can be driven by a test — the failing state needs a real over-committed GPU and cannot be arranged through any public API. `llama_model_splits_normalize()` carries **the fix**: on `split_sum == 0` it `LLAMA_LOG_WARN`s and falls back to an even split (`splits[i] = float(i+1)/splits.size()`), the only neutral choice when no device can be preferred and exactly right for a single device. `llama_model_splits_select_device()` carries **the diagnostic**: it bounds-checks the index and throws a `std::runtime_error` naming the function, the offloaded layer, the device index, the split-point count **and the split points themselves** — with NaN splits that message prints `nan` and names the cause outright, which is precisely what was missing when this had to be diagnosed by reading source. **A second, backend-independent trigger reaches the same line**, found while writing this up and verified against the unfixed library: `--tensor-split` values are parsed with `std::stof` and never range-checked (`common/arg.cpp`), so `-ts 1,-1` cancels out, `split_sum` is 0 again, the split points become `[inf, -nan]`, and every layer maps one past the last device — on CUDA, Vulkan or ROCm just as much as on Metal, with no memory pressure involved. That is what makes this an ordinary upstream defect rather than a Metal edge case, and the warning names both causes rather than only the memory one. Also adds upstream `tests/test-model-split.cpp` (5 cases in upstream's `testing.h` style) + its `llama_build_and_test` registration. Touches `src/llama-model.{cpp,h}`, `tests/test-model-split.cpp` and `tests/CMakeLists.txt` — **none** of which any other patch touches, so it is independent of all of them. Upstream-submittable ("model: fall back to an even split when no device reports free memory"); **not yet filed upstream**. **Runnable guard: `src/test/cpp/test_model_split.cpp`** — a FetchContent subproject builds with `LLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`, so the upstream test above is applied-but-never-compiled here (same as `0001`'s test). That file drives the same two functions from `jllama_test`, which runs on **every** platform in `C++ Tests`, so a bump that drops this patch fails the build at link time everywhere instead of surfacing as one red macOS Java job. **Verification limit — read before assuming this can be dropped:** the *failing path* still cannot be reached without a GPU backend, so the guard pins the arithmetic (what actually broke), not the end-to-end load; the end-to-end proof is the macOS CI job. On a bump, re-check whether upstream added its own `split_sum == 0` guard (grep `split_sum` in `src/llama-model.cpp`) and **drop this patch rather than refreshing it** if they did — the fail-loud applier detects "does not apply", never "upstream already fixed this". |
| `0013-s390x-repack-guard-vxe-only-helpers.patch` | **A new upstream file makes the s390x build fail to compile, with nothing in this project involved.** b10902 added `ggml/src/ggml-cpu/arch/s390/repack.cpp` (upstream #28667, s390x q4_0 repack; the file does not exist at b10883). Every *function body* in it is guarded `#if defined(__VXE__) || defined(__VXE2__)`, but three `static inline` helpers — `vxe_dot_acc`, `vxe_splat_granule`, `vxe_fold` — sit at file scope **between** two guarded blocks with no guard of their own, and their signatures name `int16x8_t` / `int8x16_t` / `int32x4_t`, which `ggml-cpu-impl.h` only typedefs *inside* that same guard. So a non-VXE s390x build dies with three `does not name a type` errors before it reaches any of the code it is supposed to skip. The patch wraps the three definitions in the identical guard — all 21 call sites are already inside `__VXE__` blocks, so nothing else moves. **Why this project builds s390x without VXE, which is the half that is ours:** `ggml/CMakeLists.txt` declares `option(GGML_VXE "ggml: enable vxe" ${GGML_NATIVE})` — the VXE default *follows* `GGML_NATIVE`. The `build-linux-s390x` job passes `-DGGML_NATIVE=OFF`, which is correct for a cross-build (it must not bake the x86 build host's `-march=native` into an s390x artifact) but also silently switches VXE off. No `-mvx -mzvector` is then passed, `__VEC__` is undefined, and `ggml-cpu-impl.h`'s `#if defined(__s390x__) && defined(__VEC__)` self-define of `__VXE__`/`__VXE2__` never fires. The job has therefore always produced a **scalar** s390x binary; that was invisible until a file arrived that does not compile that way. **Do not "fix" this with `-DGGML_VXE=ON`** — measured, not assumed: that makes it strictly worse, because the self-define above sets `__VXE__` *and* `__VXE2__` together as soon as `__VEC__` exists, while `-march` stays at the toolchain default `arch11`, so the three errors become dozens of `'__builtin_s390_vec_*' matching variant requires z14 or higher`. The only flag-side alternative is `-DGGML_VXE=ON` **plus** `-march=z15`, which does compile but raises the shipped artifact's hardware floor to z15 and makes the qemu `ctest` gate depend on VXE2 emulation — a real trade for vector kernels this job does not use (it is a big-endian *correctness* gate for our own layer, not a performance target). The patch keeps the configuration that worked through b10883 and changes nothing about the artifact. **Verified with the real cross toolchain** (`s390x-linux-gnu-g++`), not by inspection: unpatched + CI's flags reproduces the three CI errors exactly; patched + CI's flags compiles clean; patched + `-mvx -mzvector -march=z15` also compiles clean, so the patch does not foreclose a future vector build. Touches only that one file, which no other patch touches. Upstream-submittable ("ggml-cpu: guard the VXE-only helpers in the s390x repack path"); **not yet filed upstream**. **On a bump, check whether upstream guarded them itself and DROP this patch rather than refreshing it** — the fail-loud applier detects "does not apply", never "upstream already fixed this". There is no runnable guard for it beyond CI: the file is compiled only for s390x, so `build-linux-s390x` *is* the test, and it fails loudly at compile time. |

**`0009` was dropped at the b10280 bump.** Upstream merged
[sheredom/subprocess.h#104](https://github.com/sheredom/subprocess.h/pull/104) — the exact fix this
patch submitted — via [ggml-org/llama.cpp#26606](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/26606)
("vendor: apply patches for subprocess.h"): `vendor/sheredom/subprocess.h` at b10280 already defines
the `SUBPROCESS_HAVE_CWD` compile-time probe and the `ENOSYS` fallback our patch added, so the
old-glibc build break `0009` fixed no longer exists upstream. The applier's idempotent
`git apply --reverse --check` could **not** auto-skip this one (unlike a byte-identical carry): the
same PR also rewrote the neighboring Windows argv-quoting logic and added a `__NetBSD__` branch next
to the `process_cwd` guard, shifting the patch's second hunk's context, so it failed loud with "does
not apply cleanly" at configure time exactly as designed — confirming the patch needed to be dropped,
not refreshed. Also folded into that PR: a fix for `-std=c++20` unknown to GCC 8
([#105](https://github.com/sheredom/subprocess.h/pull/105)) and a `posix_spawn` exec-failure
reporting fix pre-glibc-2.24 ([#106](https://github.com/sheredom/subprocess.h/pull/106)) — neither
affects this project. If a regression surfaces on old-glibc builds (manylinux2014/manylinux_2_28),
re-check `vendor/sheredom/subprocess.h`'s `SUBPROCESS_HAVE_CWD` guard against this description before
reintroducing a local patch.

**`0005` was dropped at the b9981 bump.** Upstream's own `server-context.cpp` picked up an
equivalent — and broader — fix for the same checkpoint-starvation problem: `create_checkpoint`
now tracks `id_task` and evicts a stale checkpoint that sits within `checkpoint_min_step` of a
newer one (instead of our pre-creation duplicate-position check), and the `do_checkpoint` gate
now exempts **every** near-prompt-end checkpoint from the min-step spacing (`near_prompt_end`,
unconditionally) rather than only recurrent/hybrid (`ctx_tgt_seq_rm_type` `FULL`/`RS`) models as
our patch scoped it. The upstream version is a strict superset of what `0005` did, so it applies
cleanly with the patch removed and needs no replacement. If a regression in agentic multi-turn
prefill behavior shows up, re-check `tools/server/server-context.cpp`'s `create_checkpoint` /
`do_checkpoint` logic against this description before reintroducing a local patch.

**`0004` was dropped at the b9982 bump.** Upstream merged
[ggml-org/llama.cpp#23116](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/23116) verbatim: the
`b9981...b9982` diff carries the exact same `oaicompat_chat_params_parse` precedence change
(`reasoning_budget_tokens` > `thinking_budget_tokens` alias > server default, plus the per-request
`reasoning_budget_message` override) and the same two `tests/test-chat.cpp` regression cases
(`test_reasoning_budget_tokens_per_request` / `test_reasoning_budget_message_per_request`,
byte-identical body). No local patch needed — the tree already matches what `0004` used to add.

## Qwen3-TTS via `mtmd_helper::gen_audio` (was: OuteTTS build-time extraction)

The `TextToSpeech` native pipeline (`tts_engine.{h,cpp}`) drives llama.cpp's upstream Qwen3-TTS
audio-generation pipeline directly through its public C++ API — `mtmd_helper::gen_audio`
(`tools/mtmd/mtmd-helper.h`) — rather than deriving/extracting anything from upstream source. `mtmd`
is already a `target_link_libraries(jllama ...)` dependency (vision/audio-input support), so this
needed no new CMake wiring at all: no generator, no build-time extraction, no hand-written interface
header to keep in sync. Loads a backbone text GGUF (a normal `llama_model`) plus an mmproj GGUF
(speaker encoder + code predictor + code2wav decoder, all bundled in one file by upstream's
`conversion/qwen3tts.py`), and drives the streaming API: `mtmd_helper_gen_audio_set_input()` (prompt
+ optional speaker-reference audio + language) → a `step_prompt()` loop → a `step_gen()` loop (the
engine owns semantic-token sampling via a `common_sampler`, feeding each sampled token + the
backbone's hidden state into `step_gen()` and receiving the next hidden state back — the same pattern
upstream's own `tools/tts/tts.cpp` `main()` uses) → `get_output()` for raw PCM, which the engine
encodes to WAV itself via `tts_wav.hpp` (not upstream's own WAV writer) so that already-tested code
stays in the loop.

**Why this replaced OuteTTS, not extended it.** Upstream #26254 ("mtmd: support Qwen3-TTS") deleted
the entire OuteTTS implementation from `tools/tts/tts.cpp` (it shrank from ~1450 to 205 lines) and
replaced the two-model OuteTTS-(text-to-codes)-+-WavTokenizer-(vocoder) design with the single
backbone+mmproj design above — there is no upstream code path for OuteTTS left at all past b10269
(`enum mtmd_gen_audio_type` has exactly `MTMD_GEN_AUDIO_TYPE_NONE` and `MTMD_GEN_AUDIO_TYPE_QWEN3TTS`).
See `docs/history/llama-cpp-breaking-changes.md`'s `b10269–b10270` row for the full investigation;
this was a breaking **public API** change (`TextToSpeech`'s constructor and `synthesize()` overloads
all changed shape) done deliberately — the project does not carry OuteTTS-compatibility shims.

**Nothing to re-verify on a llama.cpp bump.** Because there is no generator or extracted header
anymore, a version bump cannot silently break the TTS surface the way `patches/` or the old
extraction could — `mtmd_helper::gen_audio`'s API surface is upstream's own committed public header,
covered by the normal priority-8 API-compat review (`tools/mtmd/mtmd-helper.h` is on that list).

## Upgrading/Downgrading llama.cpp Version

**Runbook (documentation root):** [`docs/upgrade/llama-cpp-version-bump.md`](docs/upgrade/llama-cpp-version-bump.md)
covers the full bump process end-to-end — picking the target (topmost GitHub release, via the atom
feed), **chunking by `git diff` byte-size** (bump straight to the target when the diff is < 100 KiB,
else step through the largest intermediate tag still under the threshold), the
`.github/scripts/llama-next-version.sh` helper that computes the next reviewable step, and the
edit/verify/commit loop below. Use it for any non-trivial bump; the steps here are the mechanical core.

To change the llama.cpp version, update the following **four** files (and re-verify `patches/`):

1. **llama/CMakeLists.txt** — the `GIT_TAG` line for llama.cpp: `GIT_TAG        b8831`. (There is
   no second tag to keep in sync any more: the cosmetic `-DLLAMA_TAG=` that fed the old build-time
   TTS extraction went away with the Qwen3-TTS rework — see "Qwen3-TTS via `mtmd_helper::gen_audio`".)
2. **README.md** — the badge and link line with the version number
3. **CLAUDE.md** — the "Current llama.cpp pinned version" line
4. **llama/src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/value/LlamaCppVersion.java** — the
   `LLAMA_CPP_VERSION` constant (the compile-time pin exposed to Java/Kotlin consumers, e.g. the
   Android version badge). It is the *pure-Java mirror* of `GIT_TAG` and must stay equal to it —
   the native `LlamaModel.getLlamaCppBuildInfo()` getter reports the actually-linked build
   (`b<number>-<commit>`), and `NativeLibraryLoadSmokeTest.nativeBuildInfoMatchesPinnedVersionConstant`
   **fails the build** if this constant and the linked binary drift apart.

Example: To upgrade from b8808 to b8831:
```bash
# Edit llama/CMakeLists.txt: change GIT_TAG b8808 to b8831
# Edit README.md: change b8808 to b8831 (in both badge and link)
# Edit CLAUDE.md: change b8808 to b8831
# Edit LlamaCppVersion.java: change LLAMA_CPP_VERSION "b8808" to "b8831"
git add llama/CMakeLists.txt README.md CLAUDE.md \
        llama/src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/value/LlamaCppVersion.java
git commit -m "Upgrade llama.cpp from b8808 to b8831"
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

**Note:** Always test the build with `cmake -B build && cmake --build build --config Release` after version changes to catch compatibility issues early.

### Inspecting API changes between versions

Use the GitHub compare URL to diff any two llama.cpp builds:

```
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/compare/b<FROM>...b<TO>
```

Example — what changed between b6721 and b6732:
```
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/compare/b6721...b6732
```

The GitHub HTML page may time out for large ranges; fall back to the API:
```
https://api.github.com/repos/ggml-org/llama.cpp/compare/b<FROM>...b<TO>
```

For individual file content at a specific build:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/b<VERSION>/common/chat.h
```

### Files to check for API compatibility

The three project C++ files (`jllama.cpp`, `server.hpp`, `utils.hpp`) pull in the following
llama.cpp headers. Any of these can introduce breaking changes on upgrade.

**Include dependency graph:**
```
jllama.cpp / server.hpp / utils.hpp

├── arg.h ──────────────────────────► common.h ─┐
├── common.h ──────────────────────────────────►├── ggml-opt.h ──► ggml.h

```

**Priority-ordered review list for upgrade diffs** (highest break risk first)

The rows below cover the known **compile/link-level** breaks from b5022 to the current pin; start any
upgrade review with them rather than the full patch. Also review the project `CMakeLists.txt` for
build-system-level breaks (e.g. renamed link targets, new required headers) — those are not visible in
header file diffs alone.

**Two failure classes this list does NOT catch, both of which have bitten the project:**

1. **A same-repo header the project includes directly but that is not reachable through the
   dependency graph above.** `tools/server/server-schema.h` broke a full build at b10273 while sitting
   outside this table; it is in it now, and the `tools/server/*.h` rule in its row generalises that.
2. **A silent *contract* change behind an unchanged signature.** b10408 reduced
   `server_task_result_metrics::to_json()` to a bare slot array and b10519 split the task; no
   signature moved, every chunk compiled and linked clean, and `LlamaModel.getMetrics()` quietly
   returned the wrong shape for hundreds of builds. The same class hit `repeat_last_n` /
   `dry_penalty_last_n` at b10273, where only a *value range* moved. Two cheap mechanical checks catch
   these where a header diff cannot — run them on any bump that touches `tools/server/`:

```bash
# request-field set + their bounds, old tag vs new
git show <old>:tools/server/server-schema.cpp | grep -oE 'field_[a-z_]+\("[a-z_0-9]+"' | sort -u
git show <old>:tools/server/server-schema.cpp | tr '\n' ' ' \
  | grep -oE 'field_[a-z]+[^(]*\("[a-z_0-9]+"[^;]*?set_(hard_)?limits\([^)]*\)'
# response keys emitted by the result types
# response keys -- both emit forms; a single-form grep misses res["k"] = ... entirely
git show <old>:tools/server/server-task.cpp | { grep -oE '\{ *"[A-Za-z_0-9.]+" *,'; \
  git show <old>:tools/server/server-task.cpp | grep -oE '\[ *"[A-Za-z_0-9.]+" *\] *='; } | sort -u
```

| File | What to watch for |
|------|-------------------|
| `common/common.h` | `common_params`/`common_params_speculative` struct fields, `model_alias` container type, `common_init_result` shape, `build_info` symbol (removed in b8831 — now `llama_build_info()` from `build-info.h`) |
| `common/chat.h` | `common_chat_parser_params` (was `common_chat_syntax`), `to_json_oaicompat`, `common_chat_msg_diff_to_json_oaicompat`, `set_tool_call_ids` |
| `common/speculative.h` | `common_speculative_init`, `common_speculative_draft`, `common_speculative_accept` signatures, struct names |
| `tools/mtmd/mtmd.h` | `mtmd_context_params` fields, `image_marker`/`media_marker` API, deprecated symbols (was `common/mtmd.h` before ~b8190) |
| `include/llama-cpp.h` | `common_init_result_ptr` type, access pattern changes (`.get()` vs `->method()`) |
| `common/arg.h` | `n_parallel` sentinel value, what moved to `download.h` across versions |
| `include/llama.h` | Core llama_ function signatures, token types, `llama_model_ptr`, renamed structs |
| `common/download.h` | `common_remote_params` struct, `headers` field format (string vs key-value pair) |
| `common/common.cpp` | Implementation of any inline API used directly |
| `common/speculative.cpp` | Speculative decoding implementation details |
| `common/chat.cpp` | Chat parsing implementation |
| `common/sampling.h` | Sampler API, `common_sampler_*` functions |
| `common/log.h` | Log macro signatures |
| `tools/mtmd/mtmd-helper.h` | `mtmd_helper::gen_audio` (used directly by `tts_engine.cpp` since the Qwen3-TTS rework — no longer safe to skip), `mtmd_helper_bitmap_init_from_file` |
| `tools/server/server-schema.h` | `eval_llama_cmpl_schema` signature (called directly by `jllama.cpp`'s `populate_completion_task`) — **b10275 dropped its `n_ctx_slot` parameter** and broke a full build without any diff review catching it, because this file is a same-repo header `jllama.cpp` includes directly rather than one pulled in transitively through `common.h`/`llama.h`; it was outside this table until that incident (see `docs/history/llama-cpp-breaking-changes.md`'s b10270–b10275 row). Also watch `server-common.h`/`server-chat.h`/`server-task.h` the same way — anything under `tools/server/*.h` that `jllama.cpp`/`jni_helpers.hpp`/`json_helpers.hpp` `#include`s directly is in scope here, not just headers reachable from the dependency graph above. |
| `common/json-schema-to-grammar.h` | Grammar API |
| `ggml/include/ggml.h` | `ggml_type` enum values (e.g. `GGML_TYPE_F16`), tensor primitives |
| `ggml/include/ggml-backend.h` | Backend/device abstraction types |
| `ggml/include/ggml-opt.h` | Optimizer params pulled in via `common.h` |

**Safe to skip** (have never caused a break; not used directly by project code):
`common/sampling.h`, `common/log.h`, `common/json-schema-to-grammar.h`,
`ggml/include/ggml.h`, `ggml/include/ggml-backend.h`, `ggml/include/ggml-opt.h`,
`ggml-alloc.h`, `ggml-cpu.h`, `peg-parser.h`, `base64.hpp`

For the full record of upstream API breaks across version ranges (b5022 &#x2192; current), including which rows required project source changes vs. which stayed inside upstream-compiled translation units, see [`docs/history/llama-cpp-breaking-changes.md`](docs/history/llama-cpp-breaking-changes.md). When bumping the `llama.cpp` version, append a new row to that file covering the upgrade range.

## Build Commands

### Java (Maven)
```bash
mvn compile          # Compiles Java and generates JNI headers
mvn test             # Run all tests (requires native library and model files)
mvn package          # Build JAR
mvn -P assembly package  # Also build the fat jar-with-dependencies uber JAR (library + Java deps + native libs); CI builds it and uploads it in the `llama-jars` artifact
mvn test -Dtest=LlamaModelTest#testGenerate  # Run a single test method
```

### Native Library (CMake)
Must run `mvn compile` first to generate JNI headers, then:
```bash
# CPU only
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release

# CUDA (Linux)
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build --config Release

# Metal (macOS)
cmake -B build -DLLAMA_METAL=ON
cmake --build build --config Release

# Optional: enable model downloading via URL
cmake -B build -DLLAMA_CURL=ON
```

Built libraries are placed in `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/{OS}/{ARCH}/`.

### Building the native library for local Java tests

`mvn test` does **not** build the native library — Maven only compiles Java
and runs surefire. The shared library must already exist on disk under the
platform-specific resource path that `LlamaLoader` resolves at runtime.
Without it the JVM throws `UnsatisfiedLinkError` and every Java test fails
immediately (it does not auto-skip).

The output path is derived by `CMakeLists.txt` from `OS_NAME` and `OS_ARCH`
detected by the helper script `.github/dockcross/dockcross-resolve-host`
(falls back to `uname` on hosts where the script is absent). The mapping
mirrors `OSInfo.translateOSNameToFolderName` on the Java side, so the same
folder name is produced on both ends.

| Host | Library file | Resource path produced by `cmake --build` |
|------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Linux x86_64 | `libjllama.so` | `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Linux/x86_64/` |
| Linux aarch64 | `libjllama.so` | `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Linux/aarch64/` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `libjllama.dylib` | `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Mac/aarch64/` |
| macOS Intel | `libjllama.dylib` | `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Mac/x86_64/` |
| Windows x86_64 | `jllama.dll` | `src/main/resources/net/ladenthin/llama/Windows/x86_64/` |

On every platform exactly **one** `jllama` library is produced: `CMakeLists.txt` forces
`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF`, so upstream `llama` and `ggml` are static libraries linked into
`jllama` (the `RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_*` block that also names the `llama`/`ggml` targets
is a no-op for them — verified against the published 5.0.5 jars, which contain only
`jllama.dll` per Windows arch). `LlamaLoader` accordingly extracts and loads a single file
from the jar (plus `ggml-metal.metal` on macOS). Historical note: upstream kherud once
shipped split `ggml` + `jllama` libraries, which is where stale "three co-located DLLs"
claims came from.

End-to-end local workflow for running Java tests:

```bash
# 1. Generate JNI headers (one-time per Java API change)
mvn -q compile

# 2. Configure + build the native library for the current host
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)
# The shared lib lands directly in src/main/resources/.../{OS}/{ARCH}/ —
# no separate install step is needed.

# 3. Ensure model files referenced by tests are present under models/.
#    The default test models (downloaded by CI in publish.yml) are:
curl -L --fail "$MODEL_URL"          --create-dirs -o models/codellama-7b.Q2_K.gguf
curl -L --fail "$RERANKING_MODEL_URL" --create-dirs -o models/jina-reranker-v1-tiny-en-Q4_0.gguf
curl -L --fail "$DRAFT_MODEL_URL"     --create-dirs -o models/AMD-Llama-135m-code.Q2_K.gguf
curl -L --fail "$REASONING_MODEL_URL" --create-dirs -o models/Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf

# 4. Run tests. Tests that need a model file self-skip via Assume.assumeTrue()
#    when their GGUF is absent, so partial model availability is OK.
mvn test
# CPU-only host (no GPU): pin GPU layers to 0
mvn test -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.test.ngl=0
# Run a single test class or method
mvn test -Dtest=MemoryManagementTest
mvn test -Dtest=LlamaModelTest#testGenerateAnswer
```

**Optional models** referenced by individual tests are gated on a system
property so CI can skip them cleanly when the GGUF is not downloaded.
The full property → consumer → default table for every `net.ladenthin.llama.*`
property the library understands (runtime + test) is the user-facing
**[System Properties Reference](README.md#system-properties-reference)** in
the README. The summary below covers only the optional-model bindings:

| Property | Default test that uses it | Model |
|----------|---------------------------|-------|
| `net.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path` | `LlamaEmbeddingsTest#testNomicEmbedLoads` | `nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf` (issue #98 regression) |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.vision.model` | `MultimodalIntegrationTest` | `SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf` (any vision-capable GGUF works) |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.vision.mmproj` | `MultimodalIntegrationTest` | matching mmproj for the vision model, e.g. `mmproj-SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf` |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.vision.image` | `MultimodalIntegrationTest` | committed default `src/test/resources/images/test-image.jpg`; override to any png/jpeg/webp/gif on disk |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.audio.model` | `AudioInputIntegrationTest` (llama.cpp discussion #13759) | audio-input model GGUF, e.g. `ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_2-1b.gguf` |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.audio.mmproj` | `AudioInputIntegrationTest` | matching audio mmproj/encoder, e.g. `mmproj-ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_2-1b-f16.gguf` |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.audio.input` | `AudioInputIntegrationTest` | committed default `src/test/resources/audios/sample.wav`; override to any `.wav`/`.mp3` on disk |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.tts.model` | `TtsIntegrationTest` | Qwen3-TTS backbone GGUF (any Qwen3-TTS-family model works) |
| `net.ladenthin.llama.tts.mmproj` | `TtsIntegrationTest` | matching mmproj GGUF (speaker encoder + code predictor + code2wav) |

Run those tests by setting the property:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=LlamaEmbeddingsTest#testNomicEmbedLoads \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.nomic.path=models/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf
mvn test -Dtest=MultimodalIntegrationTest \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.vision.model=models/SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.vision.mmproj=models/mmproj-SmolVLM-500M-Instruct-Q8_0.gguf
# The vision.image property defaults to src/test/resources/images/test-image.jpg
# (a CC-BY-4.0 / MIT-granted photo of flowers and bees by the project author);
# override only if you want to test a different image.

# Audio input (Ultravox / Qwen2.5-Omni; the audio clip has no committed default):
mvn test -Dtest=AudioInputIntegrationTest \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.audio.model=models/ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_2-1b.gguf \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.audio.mmproj=models/mmproj-ultravox-v0_5-llama-3_2-1b-f16.gguf \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.audio.input=/path/to/speech.wav   # optional: defaults to the committed src/test/resources/audios/sample.wav
mvn test -Dtest=TtsIntegrationTest \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.tts.model=models/qwen3-tts-backbone.gguf \
         -Dnet.ladenthin.llama.tts.mmproj=models/qwen3-tts-mmproj.gguf
```

`MultimodalIntegrationTest` self-skips when any of the three vision properties
points at a missing path, so a partial setup (just the vision model + the
committed image, no mmproj) lets the test class load without erroring.

**Restricted-network environments.** Some hosts (e.g. ephemeral remote
execution sandboxes) block outbound traffic to `huggingface.co`. In that
case downloading models for the Java tests is not possible from the host
itself; the native library can still be built and the C++ test suite
(`ctest --test-dir build`) still runs because it depends only on the
upstream sources fetched at CMake configure time. Java tests should then
be exercised either in CI (via `.github/workflows/publish.yml`) or on a
developer machine with HF access; pre-staged models can also be uploaded
into `models/` out-of-band.

**Verifying the native library *loads* without models (model-free smoke).**
Even with HuggingFace blocked you can still do the one piece of *real native*
verification that does not need a GGUF: confirm the library loads and its
`JNI_OnLoad` resolves every Java class it looks up by name. The model-gated
tests cannot do this in a restricted sandbox — they self-skip via
`Assume.assumeTrue(model present)` **before** the lib is ever loaded, so a plain
`mvn test` is silent on load-time breakage. The full local recipe:

```bash
# 1. Build the native lib locally (FetchContent pulls llama.cpp from GitHub,
#    which is reachable even when huggingface.co is not):
mvn -q compile
cmake -B build -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)   # -> src/main/resources/.../<os>/<arch>/libjllama.so
# 2. Force LlamaModel.<clinit> (System.load -> JNI_OnLoad) with no model:
mvn test -Dtest=NativeLibraryLoadSmokeTest
```

`NativeLibraryLoadSmokeTest` (in the `loader` package) calls
`Class.forName("net.ladenthin.llama.LlamaModel")`, which runs
`LlamaLoader.initialize() -> System.load() -> JNI_OnLoad`, which in turn calls
`FindClass(...)` for every JNI-referenced Java class. It **passes** when the lib
loads cleanly, **fails** if the native-resource path in `LlamaLoader` is wrong
(lib not found) or a `FindClass`/field-signature FQN in
`src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp` is stale after a Java package move (lib loads but
`JNI_OnLoad` throws `NoClassDefFoundError: net/ladenthin/llama/...`), and
**self-skips** when `libjllama` is not on the classpath (pure-Java checkout, no
CMake build) so it never breaks a build-less `mvn test`.

Both of those failure modes shipped on a branch once — the layered-package
restructure left (a) `LlamaLoader.getNativeResourcePath()` deriving the resource
root from the loader's own package (which moved to `…loader`) and (b)
`jllama.cpp` still `FindClass`-ing the old flat paths — and neither was visible
to a local `mvn test` (model tests skipped) or to the pure-Java unit tests.
**When you move a Java class the JNI layer references by name** (`LlamaModel`
[root], `exception.LlamaException`, `value.LogLevel`, `args.LogFormat`,
`callback.LoadProgressCallback`), update the matching `FindClass` / `"L…;"`
signature string in `src/main/cpp/jllama.cpp` and keep the native-resource root
anchored at `net/ladenthin/llama/` in `LlamaLoader.NATIVE_RESOURCE_BASE` (it must
not track the loader's own Java package). This is the same
"FQN/path not updated after a package move" class as the stale
`spotbugs-exclude.xml`, PIT `targetClasses`, and `CMakeLists.txt` OSInfo repairs.

### Code Formatting

C++ formatting is **enforced in CI** (`.github/workflows/clang-format.yml`) with a **pinned**
clang-format — currently **22.1.8**, installed via `pip install clang-format==22.1.8`. Format with
that exact version before committing; a different clang-format version reflows code differently and
will fail the check.

```bash
pip install "clang-format==22.1.8"
clang-format -i src/main/cpp/*.cpp src/main/cpp/*.hpp src/test/cpp/*.cpp   # Format C++ code
```

The generated JNI header `src/main/cpp/jllama.h` (produced by `javac -h`) is intentionally excluded.
To bump the enforced version, update the pin in **both** the workflow (`CLANG_FORMAT_VERSION`) and
this line, then reformat the whole tree with the new version in the same commit.

**`.clang-format` sets `SortIncludes: Never` — do not re-enable include sorting.** The project has
order-sensitive includes (see the "Include order rule" above): the upstream `server-*.h` headers and
`utils.hpp` must precede `json_helpers.hpp` / `jni_helpers.hpp`, which use the `json` alias those
headers define. Alphabetical sorting moves the helper headers first and breaks the build with
`'json' does not name a type` (it slips past a local build whose toolchain resolves `json` anyway,
but fails the manylinux/aarch64/Android CI compilers). Keep include order manual.

### Javadoc — must build cleanly before `mvn package`

The release packaging job runs `mvn package` with the `release` profile, which attaches
a javadoc jar via `maven-javadoc-plugin`. The plugin treats Javadoc tool **errors** as
build failures (warnings are tolerated). After changing any public/protected Java API,
verify the javadoc build succeeds locally:

```bash
mvn clean javadoc:jar -DskipTests=true -Dgpg.skip=true
# expected: BUILD SUCCESS
```

Common Javadoc errors that fail the build (not warnings):

- **Unbalanced HTML**: `</p>` without a matching `<p>`, mismatched `<ul>`/`<li>`, stray
  closing tags. Symptom: `error: unexpected end tag: </p>`.
- **Invalid `{@link …}` targets**: typo'd class, method, or parameter name.
- **Self-closing void HTML elements written as `<br>` inside `<pre>` blocks** in HTML5
  mode (rare but seen).

Common Javadoc *warnings* (do not fail the build, but should be cleaned up on new code):

- `no main description` — a doc comment containing only `@param`/`@return`/`@throws`
  tags with no leading prose. Fix: add a one-line description before the tags.
- `no @return` / `no @param` — public method missing the tag. Fix: add it.
- `no comment` — public method/field/enum constant has no doc comment at all.
- `use of default constructor, which does not provide a comment` — public class with
  no explicit constructor (the synthetic default has no Javadoc). Fix: add an explicit
  no-arg constructor with a Javadoc comment.

Preferred doc-comment shapes for getters and small value types:

```java
/**
 * Brief one-line description of the value.
 *
 * @return the value
 */
public T getThing() { ... }
```

A bare `/** @return … */` triggers `no main description`; add a leading sentence.

If the local check passes (`BUILD SUCCESS`), the `mvn package` job in
`.github/workflows/publish.yml` will pass the `attach-javadocs` step.

## Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

**Java layer** (`src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/`):
- `LlamaModel` — Main API class (AutoCloseable). Wraps native context for inference, embeddings, re-ranking, and tokenization.
- `TextToSpeech` — Separate AutoCloseable native type for speech synthesis over llama.cpp's upstream Qwen3-TTS pipeline (a backbone text GGUF + an mmproj GGUF bundling the speaker encoder, code predictor, and code2wav decoder); `synthesize(text)` returns a 24 kHz mono 16-bit WAV byte stream, with overloads for a cloned-voice speaker-reference clip and language. Native orchestration in `tts_engine.{h,cpp}` drives upstream's `mtmd_helper::gen_audio` streaming API directly (see "Qwen3-TTS via `mtmd_helper::gen_audio`" below) — there is nothing extracted or hand-copied from llama.cpp source; the in-memory WAV writer is `tts_wav.hpp`.
- `ModelParameters` / `InferenceParameters` — Builder-pattern parameter classes. Every wire name they can
  emit is an enum constant carrying the contract it must satisfy (`args.ModelOption` + `args.ModelFlag` for
  argv, `parameters.RequestField` for the request body), and the base classes accept nothing else — see
  "Wire-name registries" below. `InferenceParameters.toJson()` renders the request body; its `toString()`
  is a redacted debug view and deliberately not valid JSON.
- `LlamaIterator` / `LlamaIterable` — Streaming generation via Java `Iterator`/`Iterable`.
- `LlamaLoader` — Extracts the platform-specific native library from the JAR to a temp directory, or finds it on `java.library.path`.
- `OSInfo` — Detects OS and architecture for library resolution.
- **`server` package — OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint (a single implementation).**
  - `server.OpenAiCompatServer` — built only on the JDK's `com.sun.net.httpserver` (no new dependency), embeddable and runnable via `java -cp <jar> net.ladenthin.llama.server.OpenAiCompatServer …` (the fat-jar default `Main-Class` is now `NativeServer` — see "Two server modes"). Serves `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streaming via SSE + non-streaming), `POST /v1/completions`, `POST /v1/embeddings`, `POST /v1/rerank`, `POST /infill`, `GET /v1/models` and `GET /health` (every route is also reachable without the `/v1` prefix), so editors that speak the OpenAI protocol (e.g. VS Code Copilot "Custom Endpoint", Cline, Roo Code, Continue) can drive a local model. Streaming chat uses the native OAI chunk path (`LlamaModel.streamChatCompletion` → `requestChatCompletionStream` / `receiveChatCompletionChunk` + the C++ `wrap_stream_chunk` helper), preserving `delta.tool_calls`; completions/embeddings/infill forward verbatim to the matching `LlamaModel.handle*`; rerank reshapes `handleRerank` into the OAI `results`/`data` shape. The chat mapper forwards `stream_options` and `response_format` and defaults `cache_prompt=true`; a CORS `Filter` answers `OPTIONS` preflights; `OpenAiSseFormatter.ensureUsageCachedTokens` guarantees `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` on the streamed usage chunk (Copilot crash fix, microsoft/vscode #273482). **Agentic tool-calling is the primary target**; a C++ guard (`test_server.cpp`) pins `tool_calls.function.arguments` as a JSON string (llama.cpp #20198).
  - **Alternative protocol surfaces** (pure translation over the OpenAI chat core — no second inference path; each reconstructs streamed tool calls via `ToolCallDeltaAccumulator`): **Ollama-native** (`GET /api/version`, `/api/tags`, `POST /api/show`, `/api/chat` with NDJSON streaming, `/api/generate` prompt-completion/FIM — `OllamaApiSupport`; `/api/show` advertises tools/insert/vision capabilities + context length for Copilot's Ollama provider), **Anthropic Messages** (`POST /v1/messages`, SSE event stream — `AnthropicApiSupport` + `AnthropicStreamTranslator`), and **OpenAI Responses** (`POST /v1/responses`, SSE event stream — `ResponsesApiSupport` + `ResponsesStreamTranslator`). The llama.cpp-native `GET /props` (context length + `modalities`) is served via `OpenAiSseFormatter.propsJson` for autocomplete clients that size their context from it.
  - Supporting classes: `OpenAiServerConfig` (builder; optional bearer auth; binds `127.0.0.1`; `corsAllowOrigin`; `supportsVision`), `OpenAiServerCli` (testable CLI arg parser → `ModelParameters` + `OpenAiServerConfig`; flags incl. `--mmproj`/`-mmdev,--mmproj-device`/`--embedding`/`--reranking`), `OpenAiRequestMapper` (OAI chat request → `InferenceParameters`), `OpenAiSseFormatter` (SSE/models/error JSON + usage normalization), `OaiRerankSupport` (pure rerank request/response shaping), and the model-free test seam `OpenAiBackend`/`ChunkSink` + `LlamaModelBackend`. The streaming envelope is parsed by `json.ChatStreamChunkParser`.
  - The `server` package is a dedicated top layer in the ArchUnit `layeredArchitecture` rule (the only layer allowed to access the root `Api`); `noInternalJdkImports` carries an explicit exception for the supported `com.sun.net.httpserver` (the exported `jdk.httpserver` module, which `module-info.java` `requires`). See README "OpenAI-compatible HTTP server".

**Native layer** (`src/main/cpp/`):
- `jllama.cpp` — JNI implementation bridging Java calls to llama.cpp. ~1,900 lines; 34 native methods (30 `LlamaModel` + 3 `TextToSpeech` + 1 `LlamaQuantizer`) plus `JNI_OnLoad`/`JNI_OnUnload`.
- `utils.hpp` — Helper utilities (format helpers, argv stripping, token-piece serialisation).
- `json_helpers.hpp` — Pure JSON transformation helpers (no JNI, no llama state). Independently unit-testable.
- `jni_helpers.hpp` — JNI bridge helpers (handle management + server orchestration). Includes `json_helpers.hpp`.
- **The `json` alias is upstream's `common_json`, not `nlohmann::ordered_json` (since llama.cpp b10585, upstream #27511).** `tools/server/server-common.h` now says `using json = common_json;` — a deliberately small pimpl wrapper (`common/json.{h,cpp}`, compiled into `llama-common`) around the vendored nlohmann copy. Two traps this cost the project once, both of which **compile silently**:
  1. **An unscoped enum becomes a JSON boolean.** `common_json_value`'s integral constructor template is `std::is_integral`-gated, which excludes enums, so an enum binds to `common_json_value(bool)`. Always `static_cast<int>(...)` an enum before putting it in JSON — `jllama.cpp`'s two `"vocab_type"` sites do, and `patches/0010` does the same for upstream's own `/models` handler. Guards: `test_json_helpers.cpp`'s `CommonJsonEnumTrap` pair pins the mechanism and **does** run in CI; `LlamaModelTest`'s `isIntegralNumber()` assertion pins the real wire value and now runs in CI too (the model-gated suite no longer self-skips — see "CI model policy" below).
  2. **`common_json` converts to `std::string` implicitly**, so it binds happily to a `const nlohmann::json &` parameter (via nlohmann's string-constructible converting constructor) and then throws `json::type_error 302` at runtime. Never declare a project helper as taking `nlohmann::json` when callers pass the `json` alias — `require_json_field_impl` is a template for exactly this reason.
  Other differences to know: no `get_ref`/`array_t`/`type_name()`; a braced list in *value* position does not build an array (write `json::array({...})`); `at(key)` needs an explicit `.get<T>()`; errors are `common_json_error`; and `get<T>()` is limited to the types explicitly specialised in `common/json.cpp`. `log_helpers.hpp` and `train_engine.cpp` keep their own `nlohmann::json` alias — they never touch the server's `json`.
- Uses `nlohmann/json` for JSON deserialization of parameters in the two files named above; everything on the server path uses `common_json`.
- The upstream server library (`server-context.cpp`, `server-queue.cpp`, `server-task.cpp`, `server-schema.cpp`, `server-models.cpp`, and — since b9829 — `server-stream.cpp`) is compiled directly into `jllama` via CMake — there is no hand-ported `server.hpp` fork. **`server-stream.cpp` is mandatory, not optional:** it defines the resumable-streaming SSE replay buffer (`g_stream_sessions`, `stream_session_attach_pipe`, `stream_aware_should_stop`, `stream_conv_id_from_headers`, the `stream_pipe_*` types) that `server-context.cpp` / `server-http.cpp` / `server-models.cpp` now `#include "server-stream.h"` and call, so omitting it fails the link with undefined references. It is platform-neutral (threads + std mutex/condvar, no `subprocess.h`/`posix_spawn_*`), so it builds on Android too and sits outside the `server-models.cpp` Android guard. `jllama` wires its own JNI routes and never calls `g_stream_sessions.start_gc()` (only the excluded standalone `server.cpp` `main()` does), so its GC thread stays dormant. **Phase 2:** the upstream HTTP transport (`tools/server/server-http.cpp`) and its `cpp-httplib` backend (`vendor/cpp-httplib/httplib.cpp`) are now compiled into `jllama` too, so the OpenAI-compatible server can be driven natively from JNI *inside* `libjllama` — no separate `llama-server` executable (a JNI shared library loads anywhere a JVM runs, which a standalone binary does not). `server-http.cpp` does `#include "ui.h"` (the WebUI asset table that `tools/ui`/`llama-ui` normally generates); since the Svelte WebUI is not shipped, `src/main/cpp/webui_stub/ui.h` supplies the upstream **empty-asset** interface and leaves `LLAMA_UI_HAS_ASSETS` undefined (all static-asset-serving blocks compile out). `<cpp-httplib/httplib.h>` already resolves through `llama-common` — since upstream #27304 (b10488) not from a `PUBLIC ../vendor` include dir of its own but transitively, via the `vendor::nlohmann` / `vendor::sheredom` INTERFACE targets it links PUBLIC, each of which exports the `vendor/` root (same nlohmann/json 3.12.0 as the FetchContent copy). No SSL: `CPPHTTPLIB_OPENSSL_SUPPORT` is left undefined (plain-HTTP; bind localhost / front with a TLS proxy). **`server.cpp`, `server-tools.cpp` and `server-mcp.cpp` are now compiled in too** (on non-Android — they pull in `subprocess.h`/`posix_spawn_*`, so they share `server-models.cpp`'s Android guard): b9870 exposes `server.cpp`'s entry as `int llama_server(int, char**)` (no `main` in the file), and `patches/0006` makes it embeddable (no process signal handlers, forwarded-argv parse, out-of-band shutdown). **`server-mcp.cpp` is new in b10154** (upstream MCP-server support): both `server.cpp` (`llama_server`'s `mcp_mgr` lifecycle) and `server-tools.cpp` (`tools.setup(..., mcp_mgr)` / `server_mcp::call_tool`) reference `server_mcp`, so it **must** be in the `target_sources` list or the link fails with undefined `server_mcp::{start,shutdown,call_tool,list_tools,~server_mcp}` — **latent on Linux** (a shared object tolerates undefined symbols) but a **hard link error on macOS/ld64 and Windows/MSVC**. It is compiled only into `jllama`, not `jllama_test` (which links neither `server.cpp` nor `server-tools.cpp`). The `NativeServer` JNI bridge (`src/main/cpp/native_server.cpp`) calls `llama_server` on a worker thread, so the **full** upstream server — WebUI and all — runs inside `libjllama`. See "Two server modes" below.

### Two server modes (`OpenAiCompatServer` vs `NativeServer`)

The library exposes **two** ways to serve a model over HTTP, on two different transports. The fat jar's `Main-Class` is `server.ServerLauncher`, a tiny dispatcher: it runs `OpenAiCompatServer` when `--jllama-openai-compat` is present (that marker is stripped, the rest forwarded) and the default `NativeServer` otherwise. Both mains are also runnable directly by class name via `java -cp`. The two modes:

1. **`server.OpenAiCompatServer` (Java transport).** OpenAI/Ollama/Anthropic-compatible JSON API on the JDK's `com.sun.net.httpserver`, driving the compiled server *core* over JNI. Embeddable, no extra dependency, and it can share/reuse a `LlamaModel`. It serves **no** static assets — its `/` route is a 404, so **no WebUI**. It has its own `main` (run via `java -cp <jar> net.ladenthin.llama.server.OpenAiCompatServer …`); its CLI (`OpenAiServerCli`) maps a curated flag subset (`-m/-c/-b/-ub/-ngl/-t/-tb/-ctk/-ctv/--jinja/--chat-template-kwargs/--host/--port/--parallel/--mmproj/--api-key/--embedding/--reranking`).
2. **`server.NativeServer` (native transport) — the default fat-jar server (when `--jllama-openai-compat` is absent).** Runs the **full upstream `llama_server`** (via `patches/0006` + `native_server.cpp`) inside `libjllama`, forwarding the raw llama-server argv verbatim — so **every** llama-server flag works and the **embedded WebUI is served** (when the assets are compiled in; CI's released jars have them, local `cmake` builds use the empty-asset stub). With the classic constructor it is an **independent lifecycle** (loads its own model from the argv, like `llama-server.exe`; owns the process's llama backend + stderr logging while running); the **attach constructor** (`NativeServer(LlamaModel, String...)`, via `patches/0007`'s `llama_server_attach`) instead serves an **already-loaded `LlamaModel`** — one copy of the weights, the model's worker keeps driving inference, the HTTP routes post to its queue; caller closes the server before the model. **Router mode** (start without a model argument: `--models-dir`, `GET/POST /models`, per-request model selection) works in-JVM after `NativeServer.setWorkerCommand(...)` redirects the worker spawn to a fresh JVM (`patches/0008` — upstream re-execs its own binary, which in a JVM is `java`); the typed `server.RouterClient` (+ `value.RouterModel`, `json.RouterModelsResponseParser`) wraps the model-management endpoints (list/load/unload/await-loaded with fail-fast on failed workers) so callers don't hand-roll HTTP+JSON, and its `apiKey` constructors send `Authorization: Bearer <key>` — required for **every** one of those calls against a router started with `--api-key` since b10519 (#26347 dropped `/models` + `/v1/models` from the public-endpoint set; `/models/load` and `/models/unload` were always gated). `awaitModelLoaded` cannot observe a model hidden by a preset with `dedup-cache-models` (b10505/#27346 omits it from `GET /models` although it still loads and serves by name), so its "not listed" message names that cause explicitly; such a model is reached by issuing the request directly instead. Either way it is **single-instance per process** (upstream keeps shutdown state in file-scope globals) and **not available on Android** (the `subprocess.h` guard). `libjllama` loading anywhere a JVM runs is what makes this "no separate `llama-server.exe`" possible.

### `getMetrics()` — one object rebuilt from two upstream tasks

`LlamaModel.getMetrics()` / `getMetricsTyped()` return the single server-introspection object the
Java side has always documented: `idle` / `processing` / `deferred` / `t_start`, the cumulative and
current-window `n_*` / `t_*` counter pairs, and a `slots` array. Upstream stopped emitting that in
one piece — **b10408** (#26920) reduced `server_task_result_metrics::to_json()` to the slot array,
and **b10519** (#27376) split the task in two: `SERVER_TASK_TYPE_METRICS` keeps only the counters
(its `to_json()` is unused and returns JSON null; `to_metrics()` renders them as Prometheus text)
while `SERVER_TASK_TYPE_SLOT_GET` carries the slot array plus the idle-slot count.

`handleSlotAction(0, …)` therefore posts **both** tasks and merges the results through the pure
helper `server_metrics_to_json` (`json_helpers.hpp`, unit-tested in `test_json_helpers.cpp`), rather
than letting the Java contract follow upstream's transport split. Durations are converted from
upstream microseconds to the milliseconds the payload has always used. The merge also surfaces the
counters upstream added since — `n_prompt_tokens_cached_total` and the speculative-decoding tallies
(`n_draft_tokens_total`, `n_draft_accepted_total`, `n_draft_verif_steps_total`,
`n_accepted_per_pos_total` — upstream's own spellings, kept verbatim) — which upstream emits only
as Prometheus counters from `to_metrics()`, with no JSON representation at all; `value.ServerMetrics` exposes them with typed getters (plus a derived
`getDraftAcceptanceRate()`). No second JNI entry point and no Prometheus-text parser were needed.

The metrics task is posted with `server_task::metrics_reset_bucket` left at its default `false`, so
`getMetrics()` never resets the current-measurement window; only an HTTP `/metrics` scrape does.

### Native Helper Architecture

The project C++ helpers follow a strict semantic split:

**`json_helpers.hpp`** — Pure data transforms.
- Input: the `json` alias (upstream `common_json` since b10585), `server_task_result_ptr`, plain C++ types.
- Output: `json`, `std::vector`, `std::optional`, plain C++ types.
- Zero JNI calls (`JNIEnv*` never appears).
- Zero llama state (`llama_context*`, `llama_vocab*`, `server_context*` never appear).
- Functions are named without `_impl` suffix — they are the canonical implementation.
- Testable with JSON literals and fake result objects; no JVM and no loaded model required.
- Upstream server headers must be included by the translation unit first (they define `server_task_result_ptr`, `json`, etc.).

Functions: `get_result_error_message`, `results_to_json`, `rerank_results_to_json`,
`parse_encoding_format`, `extract_embedding_prompt`, `is_infill_request`,
`parse_slot_prompt_similarity`, `parse_positive_int_config`, `wrap_stream_chunk`,
`server_metrics_to_json`.

**`log_helpers.hpp`** — Pure log-formatting transforms.
- Input: `ggml_log_level`, message text (`const char*`), an explicit `std::time_t` timestamp.
- Output: `const char*` level label / `std::string` JSON.
- Zero JNI calls (`JNIEnv*` never appears).
- Zero llama/server state — depends only on the `ggml_log_level` enum (from `ggml.h`) and
  nlohmann/json; no upstream server headers required (more standalone than `json_helpers.hpp`).
- Functions are `[[nodiscard]] inline`, named without an `_impl` suffix — the canonical implementation.
- Testable with literal levels/strings and a fixed timestamp; no JVM and no loaded model required.

Functions: `log_level_name`, `format_log_as_json`.

**`jni_helpers.hpp`** — JNI bridge helpers, split into two layers:

*Layer A* (no server headers required): handle management.
- `jllama_context` struct — owns `server_context` (value member, pimpl inside), background
  worker thread, cached `vocab`, saved `params`, and a `readers` map for streaming tasks.
- `get_jllama_context_impl` — reads Java `ctx` handle, returns the `jllama_context*` wrapper.
  Does NOT throw on zero handle (valid no-op for destructor-style calls).
- `require_json_field_impl` — throws `"<field> is required"` if key is absent. **Templated on the JSON type on purpose**: a plain `const nlohmann::json &` parameter still accepts a `common_json` (through its `operator std::string()`) and turns the presence check into a runtime `type_error 302`.
- `jint_array_to_tokens_impl` — reads a Java `int[]` into `std::vector<int32_t>`.

*Layer B* (requires upstream server headers in the TU before `jni_helpers.hpp`): orchestration.
Includes `json_helpers.hpp` so all bridge helpers can call transforms directly.
- `utf8_to_jstring_impl` — builds a `java.lang.String` from raw standard-UTF-8 bytes via the cached
  `String(byte[], "UTF-8")` constructor. **Payload text must never go through `NewStringUTF`**: JNI
  specifies *Modified* UTF-8 input there, so standard UTF-8 containing supplementary-plane
  characters (every 4-byte emoji) is spec-invalid — Android CheckJNI aborts on it. The mirror of
  `parse_jstring`'s `String.getBytes("UTF-8")` input path.
- `json_to_jstring_impl` — serialises any `json` value to a JNI string via upstream
  `safe_json_to_str` (dump with `error_handler_t::replace`, so content ending in an incomplete
  UTF-8 sequence yields U+FFFD instead of throwing `json::type_error 316`) + `utf8_to_jstring_impl`.
- `results_to_jstring_impl` — delegates to `results_to_json` then `json_to_jstring_impl`.
- `vec_to_jarray_impl<JArray,JElem,CppElem>` — generic C++ vector → JNI primitive array.
- `embedding_to_jfloat_array_impl` — converts `std::vector<float>` to `jfloatArray`.
- `tokens_to_jint_array_impl` — converts `std::vector<int32_t>` to `jintArray`.

Functions with `_impl` suffix are called directly from `jllama.cpp`.

**Include order rule:**
```
// In jllama.cpp and any TU that uses Layer B helpers:
#include "server-context.h"   // upstream server headers must come first
#include "server-queue.h"
#include "server-task.h"
#include "server-common.h"
#include "server-chat.h"
#include "jni_helpers.hpp"    // includes json_helpers.hpp internally
```

**Adding a new pure transform** (e.g. a new JSON field parser):
- Add it to `json_helpers.hpp`. No JNI, no llama types.
- Add tests to `src/test/cpp/test_json_helpers.cpp`.

**Adding a new JNI bridge helper:**
- Add it to `jni_helpers.hpp` in the appropriate layer.
- If it needs upstream server types, put it in Layer B (after the `json_helpers.hpp` include).
- Add tests to `src/test/cpp/test_jni_helpers.cpp`.

### Parameter Flow
Java parameters are serialized to JSON strings and passed to native code, which deserializes them using nlohmann/json. This avoids complex JNI field mapping for the many llama.cpp parameters.

### Native Library Resolution
`LlamaLoader` tries in order:
1. System property `net.ladenthin.llama.lib.path`
2. `java.library.path`
3. Extracts from JAR resources at `net/ladenthin/llama/{os}/{arch}/`

### Cross-compilation
Docker-based cross-compilation scripts are in `.github/dockcross/` for **Android** targets (and the
x86_64 manylinux jobs). **Linux `aarch64` is no longer cross-compiled** — it builds natively on a
GitHub `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner (see "Linux aarch64: native ARM build" below). The
`.github/dockcross/dockcross-linux-arm64-lts` wrapper is now unused by CI (left in place; harmless).

### Linux aarch64: native ARM build

The `crosscompile-linux-aarch64` job (id kept for its downstream `needs:` reference; display name is
now **"Build and Test Linux aarch64"**) builds **natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm`**, mirroring upstream
llama.cpp's own `ubuntu-cpu` aarch64 release job (`ubuntu-24.04-arm` + **GCC 14**).

**Why it moved off dockcross.** The old `dockcross/linux-arm64-lts` image ships **GCC 8.5 / glibc
2.17**; llama.cpp **b9789** uses C++17 CTAD-in-`new`, which needs **GCC ≥ 12**, so the cross build
stopped compiling. Upstream solved the same problem by building natively on `ubuntu-24.04-arm` with
GCC 14 and ships a **glibc ≈ 2.39** ARM binary with no old-glibc compatibility layer. This repo now
does the same: the aarch64 artifact's **glibc floor rises 2.17 → ~2.39** — the same envelope
upstream's own ARM binaries require (the x86_64 artifact stays at manylinux2014 / glibc 2.17).

Wiring (mirrors the macOS native jobs, not the dockcross jobs):
- `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04-arm`; `setup-java` → `mvn compile` (generates the JNI header) → `build.sh`.
- Installs `gcc-14`/`g++-14` and exports `CC`/`CXX` (upstream parity).
- `build.sh` flags: `-DGGML_NATIVE=OFF` (portable across ARMv8 CPU generations — no build-host
  `-march` baked in) `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`, then **`ctest` runs the C++ unit suite on real ARM
  hardware** (the cross build ran no tests at all).
- sccache: `build.sh`'s Linux auto-fetch now covers `aarch64` as well as `x86_64` (it maps
  `uname -m` to the matching static-musl release); the probe still gates it, so a miss just builds
  uncached.
- Branch protection: if a required check pinned the old name "Cross-Compile Linux aarch64 (LTS)",
  repoint it to "Build and Test Linux aarch64".

### Linux s390x: big-endian cross-build + qemu test gate

`build-linux-s390x` extends the default JAR to **IBM Z (s390x, big-endian)** — the one target whose
byte order differs from every other platform. It **cross-compiles** with the GCC s390x toolchain
(`g++-s390x-linux-gnu`, native x86 speed — no emulated build) and then runs the **full C++ unit suite
under `qemu-user`** (`CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR=/usr/bin/qemu-s390x-static`, `QEMU_LD_PREFIX=/usr/s390x-linux-gnu`).
That `ctest` run is a **real big-endian correctness gate** for the byte-order-sensitive surface — the
little-endian WAV writer (`tts_wav.hpp`), the JSON/token/embedding transforms, and the JNI helpers —
which is where an endian bug in *our* code could hide. Model-backed **Java** tests are deliberately
**not** run under emulation (a JVM + GGUF inference under `qemu-user` is slow and flaky); the Java↔JNI
boundary uses host-native array copies (endian-transparent), so the C++ gate covers the actual risk.
`-DGGML_OPENMP=OFF` sidesteps cross-libgomp issues (ggml uses its own `std::thread` pool). s390x is a
CPU platform like aarch64, so it ships in the **default** JAR (`Linux-s390x-libraries` merges via the
`*-libraries` glob; `OSInfo` maps `os.arch=s390x` → `Linux/s390x`) — no classifier, no pom profile.
**Fail-loud** and in `package.needs` like every other build. (Upstream llama.cpp already supports s390x
— it ships `ubuntu-s390x` with GGUF big-endian handling — so the native inference path is upstream's
concern; this job validates only *our* layer's endian-safety.)

## Testing

### Java tests
Require a model file. The CI downloads models from HuggingFace:
- **LlamaModel tests**: CodeLlama-7B-GGUF (`codellama-7b.Q2_K.gguf`)
- **RerankingModel tests**: Jina-Reranker model

**CI model policy (publish.yml): the full model set is downloaded and exercised on EVERY
Java test job** — Linux x86_64, all three macOS arm64 jobs (Metal / no-Metal / Metal-15), and
both Windows jobs (MSVC + Ninja). That includes the nomic embedding model, the SmolVLM vision
model + mmproj, and the Qwen3-TTS backbone + mmproj (`ggml-org/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-GGUF`,
smallest available quants: `Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-Q4_K_M.gguf` backbone +
`mmproj-Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base-Q8_0.gguf` mmproj — no smaller mmproj quant is published), with
their `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.*` properties set, so `LlamaEmbeddingsTest`, `MultimodalIntegrationTest`,
and `TtsIntegrationTest` are **intended** to run on every platform rather than self-skipping.

**How the paths resolve (this was silently broken until it was fixed after the b10618 bump).**
Surefire's working directory defaults to the **module** basedir (`<workspace>/llama`), while the
shared GGUF cache is restored to `<workspace>/models/` and every model path — the `TestConstants`
constants and the `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.*` properties alike — is stated relative as `models/…`.
Those therefore resolved to `<workspace>/llama/models/…`, which does not exist: **every**
model-gated class aborted in its `@BeforeAll` `Assumptions.assumeTrue(file.exists())` and reported
as *nothing at all* while the job still went green, on every `test-java-*` job. Note the precise
shape, because it defeats the obvious guard: a class-level `@BeforeAll` assumption makes Surefire
record `tests="0" errors="0" skipped="0"` — the class contributes **no** test entries, so a check of
the form "did this run skip anything?" is blind to it. The only thing that catches it directly is a
floor on the number of tests actually executed (see `TODO.md`). It is why several stale
assertions (e.g. `LlamaModelTest#testGetMetrics` against a payload shape upstream had dropped at
b10408) never failed in CI. The fix is **`TestConstants.resolveModelPath` /
`resolveModelProperty`**, which accept either layout — module-relative first, then the reactor root
— so a developer with models under `llama/models/` and CI with them at the workspace root both
work, with no workflow change. Every `TestConstants` path constant is routed through it, as is
every `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.*` fixture property; `TestConstantsTest` pins both the resolver and
the wiring (a future edit that drops the wrapper from a constant fails that test rather than
silently re-muting the suite). `llama-langchain4j` had the identical defect and carries the same
resolver as `TestModelPaths` (test classes are not shared between modules).

`validate-models.{sh,bat}`
treats all of these as **required** (a missing model hard-fails the job before tests run, so a
download regression can never silently downgrade to a skip). **Two** classes still self-skip on
every platform, both because their model is outside the manifest: `AudioInputIntegrationTest` — the
prompt clip is committed (`src/test/resources/audios/sample.wav`) but the audio model + mmproj have
no CI download — and `LlamaTrainerIntegrationTest`, whose `net.ladenthin.llama.train.model` property
is set by no job and whose model is in no `models.csv` row. The trainer one matters more than it
looks: `train_engine.cpp` carries the same `postprocess_cpu_params` pair as `tts_params.hpp`, so the
JVM-abort class of bug documented under "Qwen3-TTS" can regress there with no runnable guard. Two
slices of it are now covered without a model — `test_tts_params.cpp` drives `build_train_params` and
`jllama::resolve_cpu_params`, and `test_wire_contracts.cpp` pins the configuration key set against
`TrainingField` — but the Java → JNI → native round trip itself still runs nowhere.
The model set has a **single source of truth: `.github/models.csv`** (one `filename,url` row per
model; `#` comments). Everything derives from it: the **`download-models`** job (ubuntu,
`needs: startgate`) is the only place models are fetched from HuggingFace (one manifest-driven
`curl` loop; files already restored from cache are skipped) and the **only writer** of the shared
GGUF cache (path `models/`, key **`gguf-models-<hash of models.csv>`** — so *editing the manifest
automatically creates a fresh complete cache entry*; no manual cache deletion on a model-set
change). The writer sets **`enableCrossOsArchive: true`**, making the one ubuntu-built entry the
same entry macOS and Windows restore. A **`verify-model-cache` matrix job** (ubuntu / macOS /
Windows, `needs: download-models`) then proves the entry is restorable
(`actions/cache/restore` + `fail-on-cache-miss: true`) **and complete**
(`validate-models.{sh,bat}`, which read their required list from the same manifest) on every OS
**before any model-consuming job starts** — all `test-java-*` jobs, the langchain4j integration
job, the Android emulator job and the fat-jar smoke jobs `need: verify-model-cache` and use the
**restore-only** action themselves (no per-job download, no save — a consumer can never re-save
an empty/partial entry), keeping validate as a per-job integrity guard. (This design hardened
after run 28805360584: without the cross-OS flag, cache entries are versioned per-OS and the
unreachable Windows-side entry had been re-saved **empty** (343 B) after an eviction; and
`validate-models.bat`'s quoted `MODELS` list broke cmd's for-tokenization so its `exit /b 1`
never fired — the empty cache sailed through the "gate" and the Windows jobs silently
self-skipped every model-backed test until the fat-jar smoke's hard check caught it.) The
`*_MODEL_NAME` workflow env vars remain consumer-side wiring for the `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.*`
test properties and must match the manifest's filename column — locally the model tests still
self-skip when a GGUF is absent (`Assume.assumeTrue`), so a partial local checkout is fine.

Set the model path via system property or environment variable (see test files for exact property names).

Test files are in `src/test/java/net/ladenthin/llama/` and `src/test/java/examples/`.

### C++ unit tests

**No JVM and no model file required.** All tests run on pure data structures using mock
objects. The binary is named `jllama_test` and is built by CMake when `BUILD_TESTING=ON`.

#### Commands

```bash
# 1. Configure (once per fresh clone or after CMakeLists.txt changes)
cmake -B build -DBUILD_TESTING=ON

# 2. Build (incremental; -j$(nproc) uses all CPU cores)
cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)

# 3. Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

# Count tests across all files
grep -rn "^TEST\b\|^TEST_F\b\|^TEST_P\b" src/test/cpp/ | wc -l

# Run a single named test (GoogleTest filter syntax)
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -R "ResultsToJson"
```

#### Test files

| File | Tests | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| `src/test/cpp/test_utils.cpp` | 167 | Upstream helpers: `server_tokens`, `server_grammar_trigger`, `gen_tool_call_id`, `json_value`, `json_get_nested_values`, UTF-8 helpers, `format_response_rerank`, `format_embeddings_response_oaicompat`, `oaicompat_completion_params_parse`, `oaicompat_chat_params_parse`, `are_lora_equal`, `strip_flag_from_argv`, `token_piece_value`, `json_is_array_and_contains_numbers`, `format_oai_sse`, `format_oai_resp_sse`, `format_anthropic_sse`, `parse_lora_request`, `common_chat_parse` over malformed UTF-8 (the `ContentOnlyParseUtf8` guard for `patches/0011`) |
| `src/test/cpp/test_server.cpp` | 206 | Upstream result types: `server_slot_stats` (the `timings` JSON payload; replaced `result_timings` in b10408), `task_params::to_json()` (incl. `dry_sequence_breakers`, `preserved_tokens`, `timings_per_token`), `completion_token_output`, `server_task_result_cmpl_partial` (non-oaicompat + `to_json_oaicompat` + logprobs + `to_json_oaicompat_chat` + `to_json_anthropic` + dispatcher), `server_task_result_cmpl_final` (non-oaicompat + `to_json_oaicompat` + `to_json_oaicompat_chat` + `to_json_oaicompat_chat_stream` + `to_json_anthropic` + `to_json_anthropic_stream` + tool_calls + dispatcher), `server_task_result_embd`, `server_task_result_rerank`, `server_task_result_metrics` (`to_metrics()` = the `/metrics` Prometheus exposition text; its `to_json()` has been unused since b10519 and returns `json{}` = JSON null), `server_task_result_slots` (`to_json()` = the `/slots` array, fed by the b10519 `SERVER_TASK_TYPE_SLOT_GET` task), `server_task_result_slot_save_load`, `server_task_result_slot_erase`, `server_task_result_apply_lora`, `server_task_result_get_lora`, `server_task_result_error`, `format_error_response`, `server_task::need_sampling()`, `server_task::n_tokens()`, `server_schema::eval_llama_cmpl_schema()` (parsing pipeline + grammar routing + error paths + per-request `dry_*` and `sse_ping_interval` field round-trips incl. hard-limit + server-default inheritance), `response_fields` projection |
| `src/test/cpp/test_json_helpers.cpp` | 63 | All functions in `json_helpers.hpp`: `get_result_error_message`, `results_to_json`, `rerank_results_to_json` (incl. missing/out-of-range `index` rejection), `parse_encoding_format`, `extract_embedding_prompt`, `is_infill_request`, `parse_slot_prompt_similarity`, `parse_positive_int_config`, `wrap_stream_chunk`, `server_metrics_to_json` |
| `src/test/cpp/test_log_helpers.cpp` | 13 | All functions in `log_helpers.hpp`: `log_level_name`, `format_log_as_json` |
| `src/test/cpp/test_jni_helpers.cpp` | 56 | All functions in `jni_helpers.hpp` using a zero-filled `JNINativeInterface_` mock (incl. the `utf8_to_jstring_impl` byte-array string path: emoji byte-preservation, truncated-UTF-8 replace-not-throw) |
| `src/test/cpp/test_tts_wav.cpp` | 2 | The in-memory WAV writer `pcm_to_wav16_bytes` in `tts_wav.hpp` (WAV header/payload + little-endian clamping) — our own code, not upstream. The Qwen3-TTS pipeline it pairs with (`mtmd_helper::gen_audio`) is entirely upstream-owned (no project-side DSP to unit-test here). The load path is additionally covered by `test_tts_params.cpp` (3 tests over `tts_params.hpp`'s `build_tts_params`, plus 2 pinning the upstream `-1` default it depends on), which pins the CPU-thread resolution whose absence used to crash the JVM on every platform — see the `TODO.md` entry for the mechanism. End-to-end coverage is `TtsIntegrationTest`, which is model-gated. |
| `src/test/cpp/test_tts_params.cpp` | 13 | The **three** builders every hand-assembled `common_params` goes through: `build_tts_params` (`tts_params.hpp`), `build_train_params` (`train_params.hpp`) and the shared `jllama::resolve_cpu_params` (`cpu_params.hpp`). Each builder is guarded separately on purpose — testing the resolver alone does **not** cover its call sites, because `train_engine.cpp` is compiled into `jllama` only, never into `jllama_test`, and `LlamaTrainerIntegrationTest` is gated on `net.ladenthin.llama.train.model`, which no CI job sets. Without these the JVM-abort bug could regress in the trainer on every platform, unseen. |
| `src/test/cpp/test_model_split.cpp` | 7 | The two `load_tensors()` split helpers that `patches/0012` extracts out of llama.cpp's `src/llama-model.cpp` — `llama_model_splits_normalize` (proportional split, single device, and the zero-sum case that used to produce NaN, **and the cancelling `--tensor-split` case** — `-ts 1,-1` reaches the identical line on any backend with no GPU memory pressure at all) and `llama_model_splits_select_device` (every layer maps to a real device index; malformed split points throw a message that names the function, the layer, the index and the split values instead of libc++'s bare `"vector"`). **This is the runnable guard for `0012`**: the patch also ships an upstream `tests/test-model-split.cpp`, but a FetchContent subproject builds with `LLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`, so that one is applied-but-never-compiled here. This file is the only place the two functions are linked in CI, on every platform — so a bump that drops the patch fails the `C++ Tests` build outright rather than resurfacing as one red macOS Java job. It is the one test file that includes an **internal** upstream header (`llama-model.h`, via the `${llama.cpp_SOURCE_DIR}/src` include dir added for it), which is deliberate: a signature drift should fail loudly at compile time. |
| `src/test/cpp/test_model_flags.cpp` | 4 | **The contract between the Java CLI-flag registries and llama.cpp's server argument parser.** CMake reads `ModelFlag.java` + `ModelOption.java` (`cmake/extract-java-wire-names.cmake` → a generated header of `{name, contract}` pairs), and this file asserts every `SERVER_PARSER` name is in `common_params_parser_init(params, LLAMA_EXAMPLE_SERVER).options`. It exists because **no Java test can catch this class**: `ModelFlagTest`/`ModelParametersExtendedTest` pin the *string mapping* (`hasKey("--mlock")`), never that llama.cpp still accepts the string, so they stay green forever while the flag is dead — and `common_params_parse` treats an unregistered option as a hard error, so the affected builder method makes the model **unloadable**, not merely ineffective. **A grep over `arg.cpp` is not a substitute**: `--grp-attn-n`/`-w` are present there at every pinned tag but `set_examples()`-scoped to `LLAMA_EXAMPLE_COMPLETION`/`PASSKEY`, so the server parser rejects them exactly like a deleted flag — only the real option table sees that. `--vocab-only` is the one exemption, and it declares itself `CliContract.PROJECT_PSEUDO` on its own constant rather than appearing in a list inside this file; the test asserts such a name is **still unknown** to the parser (an exemption upstream later registers would be hiding a real check) and that the exempt set is non-empty. |
| `src/test/cpp/test_wire_contracts.cpp` | 6 | **The same contract for the two quieter surfaces.** `RequestField` against `server_schema::make_llama_cmpl_schema(...)` (5 tests) and `TrainingField` against `jllama_train::config_keys()` (1 test). Both receivers *silently ignore* an unknown key — the schema skips it, `train_engine.cpp` reads with `j.value(key, default)` and falls back — so a dead field produces no error anywhere and every string-mapping test keeps passing. `OAI_LAYER`-declared keys (consumed by `oaicompat_*_params_parse` before the schema) are exempt from the schema check, and are checked **both** ways: still unknown to the schema (the inverted check), and read by at least one upstream reader-shaped site (the configure-time sweep — this is what caught `chat_template`, a key a public builder wrote and nothing read). See [`docs/history/parameter-wire-surface.md`](docs/history/parameter-wire-surface.md). |

**Current total: 537 tests (all passing).**

#### Upstream source location (in CMake build tree)

llama.cpp is fetched via CMake FetchContent, pinned to `GIT_TAG b10909`.

**GoogleTest** is a separate `BUILD_TESTING`-only FetchContent (`GIT_TAG v1.17.0`), used solely
by the `jllama_test` C++ unit-test binary — not by the shipped library, and not coupled to the
llama.cpp pin or the bundled nlohmann/json. There is **no constraint behind the exact tag**; it
is just the latest stable at the time it was last touched. Bump it from time to time (nothing
auto-tracks it), pairing the bump with a green `C++ Tests` CI run.

```
build/_deps/llama.cpp-src/tools/server/   ← server-task.h, server-common.h, etc.
build/_deps/llama.cpp-src/include/        ← llama.h, llama-cpp.h
build/_deps/llama.cpp-src/common/         ← common.h, chat.h, arg.h, etc.
```

When reading a `to_json()` implementation to write tests against it, read from:
`build/_deps/llama.cpp-src/tools/server/server-task.cpp`

#### Mock JNI pattern used in test_jni_helpers.cpp

```cpp
// Zero-fill the interface so all unpatched fn pointers are nullptr
JNINativeInterface_ iface = {};
// Patch only the stubs this test needs, e.g.:
iface.GetLongField  = [](JNIEnv*, jobject, jfieldID) -> jlong { return some_handle; };
iface.ThrowNew      = [](JNIEnv*, jclass, const char*) -> jint { return 0; };
// Wire up the env
JNIEnv_ fake_env = {};
fake_env.functions = &iface;
JNIEnv *env = &fake_env;
```

Any stub that is called but not patched will crash (null function pointer) — deliberately,
so missing stubs are caught immediately rather than silently.

#### How to add a new C++ test

1. Open the appropriate `src/test/cpp/test_*.cpp`:
   - Pure JSON transform → `test_json_helpers.cpp`
   - JNI helper → `test_jni_helpers.cpp`
   - Upstream result type `to_json()` → `test_server.cpp`
   - `utils.hpp` function or upstream utility → `test_utils.cpp`
   - A function one of the local `patches/` adds to llama.cpp → its own file, e.g.
     `test_model_split.cpp` for `0012`. Give every patch that introduces a callable a
     guard here: upstream tests carried by a patch are **not** compiled (a FetchContent
     subproject sets `LLAMA_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`), so this is the only place a dropped patch
     reds CI on every platform instead of on whichever job happens to hit it.
2. Add a `TEST(SuiteName, TestName) { ... }` block using GoogleTest macros.
3. Rebuild: `cmake --build build --config Release -j$(nproc)`
4. Run: `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`
5. Commit with message summarising coverage added and new test total.

#### Finding untested code paths

```bash
# List all functions defined in a header
grep -n "^inline\|^static\|^\[\[nodiscard\]\]" src/main/cpp/utils.hpp

# Check which functions already have tests
grep -n "function_name" src/test/cpp/*.cpp

# Find all fields in an upstream to_json() method
grep -n "\"field_name\"" build/_deps/llama.cpp-src/tools/server/server-task.cpp

# Check which JSON fields Java actually reads (important: must test these)
grep -rn "field_name" src/main/java/net/ladenthin/llama/
```

#### Testing complex scenarios — methodology

Simple tests verify individual field values on a default-constructed struct.
Complex tests verify **control flow**: switch dispatchers, cross-cutting flags, and
multi-step parameter pipelines.  The same build/run/commit loop applies.

**1. Dispatcher (switch) coverage**

Every `to_json()` that is a switch on `res_type` has one test per arm:

```cpp
// Pattern: set is_updated=true, set res_type, call to_json(), check the
// distinguishing field that differs between arms.
server_task_result_cmpl_final f;
f.is_updated = true;
f.stream     = false;
f.res_type   = TASK_RESPONSE_TYPE_OAI_CMPL;
// ... set required fields ...
const json j = f.to_json();
EXPECT_EQ(j.at("object").get<std::string>(), "text_completion");
```

The same pattern handles the `stream` flag fork inside `OAI_CHAT`:
`stream=false` → single object with `"object":"chat.completion"`;
`stream=true`  → JSON array of chunks with `"object":"chat.completion.chunk"`.

**2. Cross-cutting flag interaction**

Some flags (verbose, include_usage, timings.prompt_n) cut across multiple formatters.
Test each flag in one formatter only — they share the same code path:

```cpp
// verbose=true must add __verbose to the first chunk/top-level object
f.verbose = true;
EXPECT_TRUE(j.contains("__verbose"));

// timings absent when prompt_n < 0 (default), present when >= 0
f.timings.prompt_n = 5;
EXPECT_TRUE(j.contains("timings"));
```

**3. Parameter parsing (`eval_llama_cmpl_schema`) without a model**

`server_schema::eval_llama_cmpl_schema(vocab, params_base, logit_bias_eog, data)`
can be called with `nullptr` vocab **if the JSON does not trigger grammar/preserved_tokens
tokenisation** (those are the only vocab-dependent paths).  This lets us test the full
parsing pipeline including error throws.  **It takes four arguments** — the `n_ctx_slot`
parameter was dropped at b10275; a five-argument call has not compiled since.  `test_server.cpp`
wraps it in a `parse_params` helper, which is the form to copy:

```cpp
namespace {
task_params parse_params(const json &data) {
    common_params params_base;
    std::vector<llama_logit_bias> no_bias;
    return server_schema::eval_llama_cmpl_schema(nullptr, params_base, no_bias, data);
}
} // namespace

// test: a value inside the hard limits round-trips
EXPECT_EQ(parse_params({{"sse_ping_interval", 5}}).sse_ping_interval, 5);

// test: out-of-range and malformed values throw std::invalid_argument
EXPECT_THROW(parse_params({{"repeat_last_n", -1}}), std::invalid_argument);
EXPECT_THROW(parse_params({{"dry_sequence_breakers", json::array()}}), std::invalid_argument);
```

Note what the second line pins: `repeat_last_n` and `dry_penalty_last_n` carry
`set_hard_limits(0, INT32_MAX)` since **b10273**, so `-1` is simply out of range.  It does
**not** expand to the slot context size any more — an older version of this section said it did.

**4. Array-returning formatters**

Some methods (e.g. `to_json_oaicompat_chat_stream()`) return a JSON array of event objects,
not a single object.  Check with `is_array()` first, then iterate or index:

```cpp
const json j = f.to_json_oaicompat_chat_stream();
ASSERT_TRUE(j.is_array());
ASSERT_GE(j.size(), 1u);
// Last chunk always has a non-null finish_reason
EXPECT_FALSE(j.back().at("choices")[0].at("finish_reason").is_null());
```

**5. `response_fields` projection**

`to_json_non_oaicompat()` supports a projection list via `response_fields`.
When non-empty, only those dot-separated paths survive:

```cpp
f.response_fields = {"content", "tokens_predicted"};
const json j = f.to_json_non_oaicompat();
EXPECT_TRUE(j.contains("content"));
EXPECT_FALSE(j.contains("stop_type"));  // filtered out
```

## Key Constraints

- **Java 8+** runtime required. Built with JDK 21 targeting bytecode 1.8 for broad compatibility.
- Native memory allocated by llama.cpp is not GC-managed — always use `LlamaModel` in try-with-resources or call `close()` explicitly.
- The `server.hpp` file is adapted from llama.cpp upstream — minimize modifications to ease future upgrades.
- Platform-specific native libraries must be pre-built and placed under `src/main/resources/` before packaging for distribution.

## Javadoc Conventions

See [`../workspace/policies/javadoc-conventions.md`](../workspace/policies/javadoc-conventions.md).

## Java 8 bytecode floor — what may ship

This artifact targets **Java 8** (`release 8`), so **every class a consumer's JVM can load must be
class-file major 52 or lower**. Two entries in `llama/pom.xml` exist only for that, and both are
easy to undo by accident:

- **`slf4j-simple`, not logback, is the shipped SLF4J binding.** Every logback release from 1.4.0 on
  is Java 11 bytecode, so `LogbackServiceProvider` cannot load on Java 8 — SLF4J's `ServiceLoader`
  finds it at startup and the JVM throws `UnsupportedClassVersionError`. The Java 8 line (1.3.x) is
  end-of-life (last release 1.3.16, 2025-10-29) and every logback CVE disclosed since has been fixed
  only in 1.5.x/1.6.x with no backport, so it is not an option either. `slf4j-simple` is six classes
  from the same release train as `slf4j-api`, with no configuration or socket layer for a CVE to
  live in. Configure it with a classpath `simplelogger.properties` or `-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.*`.
- **`checker-qual` is `provided` scope, not a pinned old version.** Its annotations are major 55
  from 4.0.0 on and `@Retention(RUNTIME)`, so anything reflecting over an annotated element (Jackson
  does) loads them and a Java 8 JVM throws `UnsupportedClassVersionError`. **Pinning the shipped copy
  to the last Java 8 line (3.55.1) does not work** — that was shipped in #411 and broke `main`
  outright: the Nullness Checker resolves its own qualifiers through javac's symbol table, i.e. the
  *compile classpath*, so a 3.x checker-qual under the 4.x processor fails every build with
  `Could not load type: org.checkerframework.framework.qual.DoesNotUnrefineReceiver`. Processor and
  qualifiers must share a major version. `provided` satisfies both constraints: 4.2.2 on the compile
  classpath where the checker needs it, and excluded from consumers' graph **and** from the fat jar
  (`jar-with-dependencies` takes scope `runtime`), so no checker-qual class of any version ships.
  `<optional>true</optional>` would not have been enough on its own — that descriptor filters on
  scope only. Safe because no source imports `org.checkerframework`.

**The gate: `.github/verify-bytecode-version.sh`.** Kept **byte-identical** across java-llama.cpp /
BitcoinAddressFinder / streambuffer / srcmorph (checksum table in `workspace/crossrepostatus.md`).
It opens every `.class` in every jar it is given and fails on any whose class-file major version
exceeds `--max-major`:

```bash
.github/verify-bytecode-version.sh --max-major 52 [--allow '<jar>:<entry>']... <jar-or-dir>...
```

Paths may be jars or directories (searched recursively for `*.jar`), so one invocation covers a whole
artifact set — here all 16 classifier jars plus every `all-<os>-<arch>` fat jar. `module-info.class`
and `META-INF/versions/**` are skipped unconditionally: a classpath JVM never loads either, which is
why a `release 9` `module-info` is fine. `--allow` is a repeatable glob matched against
`<jar-basename>:<entry-path>` for anything else that must be tolerated. Exit codes: 0 clean,
1 violations, **2 nothing to scan** (an empty input is a failure, never a pass — the first version of
this check reported a clean pass over a directory a failed build had left empty).

It runs twice: in the `package` job over `llama/target` (every classifier jar plus the default fat
jar, as early as they exist), and again in `smoke-fatjar-linux` over the downloaded `fatjars/` —
`package-fatjars` rewrites those zips, and they are the artifacts users actually download.

**Surefire AND PIT both exclude `org.slf4j:slf4j-simple` from the test classpath**
(`classpathDependencyExcludes` in each). Runtime scope is on the test classpath too, and LogCaptor
(test scope) requires logback specifically — with both providers present SLF4J's `ServiceLoader`
picks one arbitrarily and the LogCaptor assertions fail. The exclusions leave logback the sole
provider in tests and do not touch the artifact: the jar and the fat jar still ship slf4j-simple.

**The PIT half is not redundant, and forgetting it is a trap worth naming.** `spotbugs:check` and
`spotless:check` bind to `verify`, so `mvn test` misses them — a different trap. This one is
sharper: **PIT builds its own classpath and never reads Surefire's configuration**, so a
Surefire-only exclusion leaves the mutation run with two providers. It then aborts the whole gate
with *"N tests did not pass without mutation … requires a green suite"* — a red gate on a suite
Surefire had just reported green, which reads like a PIT bug rather than a classpath one. This
shipped once (#411 added the binding with only the Surefire exclusion; the five affected
LogCaptor tests reddened `Java Tests Ubuntu` and the failure went unseen because every publish run
in between was cancelled). The sibling repo srcmorph hit the identical thing and solved it a
different way — there both providers arrive transitively, so it excludes at the dependency instead.
Same rule either way: **one SLF4J provider on the test classpath, enforced everywhere a test
classpath is built.**

## SpotBugs Suppressions

See [`../workspace/policies/spotbugs-suppressions.md`](../workspace/policies/spotbugs-suppressions.md).

**`spotbugs:check` binds to `verify`, so neither `mvn test` nor `mvn package` runs it.** A change
can pass every local gate and still red the pipeline in the `Code style (spotless) + package graph`
job. Before pushing, run what that job runs:

```bash
mvn -B --no-transfer-progress -f llama/pom.xml -DskipTests -Denforcer.skip=true compile spotbugs:check
```

This has actually shipped twice. Most recently the `--flash-attn` / `--lazy-mode` work reddened
`main`: the design-intent `OCP_OVERLY_CONCRETE_PARAMETER` suppression in
`llama/spotbugs-exclude.xml` lists methods **by name**, so renaming `setTensorReadLazy` to
`setLazyMode` left a dead entry while the new `setLazyMode` and `setFlashAttn` were uncovered. **Any
rename or addition of an enum-valued `ModelParameters` setter needs that list updated in the same
commit** — `setLoadMode` was added to it for exactly this reason — the same "FQN not updated after a rename" class as the stale PIT `targetClasses` and
`CMakeLists.txt` OSInfo repairs.

**Half of that is now a test.** `WireNameRegistryTest.everyOcpSuppressionStillNamesAnEnumValuedSetter`
asserts every method named in those suppressions still exists as an enum-valued setter, which is the
half nothing else covers: a suppression for a method that no longer exists is silently inert, so the
next real finding on the renamed method arrives as a surprise. The opposite direction — a flagged
setter *missing* from the list — already reds `spotbugs:check`, and is not derivable by reflection
anyway: SpotBugs raises OCP only when a method uses nothing beyond the interface, so `setPoolingType`
(compares a concrete constant) and `withMiroStat` (calls `ordinal()`) are legitimately absent.

## PIT Mutation Testing

See [`../workspace/policies/pit-mutation-testing.md`](../workspace/policies/pit-mutation-testing.md).
Run PIT with the lifecycle prefix — `mvn test-compile org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage`
(from the repo root add `-f llama/pom.xml`). The gate is **hermetic** — no model or audio fixture
needed: `ContentPartTest`'s `@TempDir` tests cover `value.ContentPart.audioFile(Path)` (verified
318/318 killed, 0 NO_COVERAGE, test strength 100% in a fixture-less sandbox; the former
audio-fixture gotcha is resolved).
**`net.ladenthin.llama.value.*` is a target at `mutationThreshold` 100**, so a new getter on a
`value` type needs its own test or the gate reds — the `ServerMetrics` counters added for the
`getMetrics()` merge are covered by `ServerMetricsTest`.

**`parameters.JsonParameters` is on the gate too**, because it carries the one-JSON-value invariant
rather than plumbing. The rest of the `parameters` package is deliberately **not**: ~200 one-line
builder setters would add cost without signal. Getting `JsonParameters` to 100% needed one test more
than expected — the bounded excerpt in its rejection message is observable only *exactly* at the
limit, so it is pinned from both sides.

## JPMS Module Descriptor

This repo ships a `module-info.java` compiled in a separate `release 9` execution. Javadoc
currently runs in **classpath mode** (javadoc `<source>` is `1.8`), which is the *only* thing
keeping it clear of the JPMS module-mode javadoc trap that bit BAF. **Before raising the Java /
javadoc source level to ≥ 9, read**
[`../workspace/policies/jpms-module-descriptor.md`](../workspace/policies/jpms-module-descriptor.md).

## Repository layout — Maven reactor (`llama/` + `llama-langchain4j/` + `llama-kotlin/`) + the `llama-android/` Gradle build

The repo root is a thin **aggregator/parent POM** (`net.ladenthin:llama-parent`,
`packaging=pom`) with three modules:

- **`llama/`** — the native JNI core (`net.ladenthin:llama`). *All the core sources and build
  files live here now:* `llama/src/`, `llama/CMakeLists.txt`, `llama/cmake/`, `llama/patches/`,
  `llama/pom.xml`, `llama/spotbugs-exclude.xml`, `llama/lombok.config`, `llama/.clang-format`.
  Its published coordinates are unchanged (`net.ladenthin:llama`), so consumers are unaffected.
- **`llama-langchain4j/`** — the LangChain4j adapters (see below).
- **`llama-kotlin/`** — the Kotlin coroutines façade (see "Android AAR + Kotlin façade" below).

All modules inherit the single `<version>` from the parent, so they **ship in lockstep by
construction** (no CI guard needed). The parent also holds the shared `release` profile (GPG +
Central Publishing), so one reactor `mvn -P release deploy` signs and publishes all four
Maven artifacts (`llama-parent` pom, `llama`, `llama-langchain4j`, `llama-kotlin`) at the same
version.

**`llama-android/` is deliberately NOT a reactor module** but a standalone plain-Gradle build
(no AGP, no Android SDK needed to build): Maven cannot produce or deploy an artifact with
`<packaging>aar</packaging>` (the only android-maven-plugin is dead), while Gradle's built-in
`maven-publish` can. It stays version-locked anyway — `llama-android/build.gradle.kts` parses
the version and the mirrored dependency versions out of the Maven poms at configure time, so
`mvn versions:set` remains the single bump point (no Gradle-side edit on a bump). See
"Android AAR + Kotlin façade" below.

**Consequences for build commands:** the core's cmake/native build runs *in `llama/`*.
`.github/build.sh` / `build.bat` `cd` into `llama/` themselves (relative to the script), so CI
and the dockcross containers (whose workdir stays the repo root) are unaffected. Locally, run
core cmake builds from `llama/` (e.g. `cd llama && cmake -B build && cmake --build build`), and
target the core with Maven via `-f llama/pom.xml` (or `-pl llama -am` from the root). A plain
`mvn` at the root builds the whole reactor. **When a build-command example elsewhere in this
file shows `cmake -B build` / `src/main/...` / `mvn compile` at the root, read it as running in
`llama/`** (the paths moved; the recipes are otherwise unchanged).

**Version bump:** the child modules declare **no `<version>` of their own** — their *project*
version is inherited from the parent. But each child still hardcodes the parent version inside its
`<parent><version>` pointer (Maven requires a literal there — there is **no `${revision}`/CI-friendly
versioning** here), so a version change must be applied to **all four poms in lockstep**:

- `pom.xml` (root) — `<version>`
- `llama/pom.xml` — `<parent><version>`
- `llama-langchain4j/pom.xml` — `<parent><version>`
- `llama-kotlin/pom.xml` — `<parent><version>`

(`llama-android/` needs **no** edit — its Gradle build reads the root pom's version at
configure time.)

The safe way is `mvn -q versions:set -DnewVersion=X.Y.Z -DgenerateBackupPoms=false` from the repo
root (it updates the parent and every child `<parent>` reference at once). Changing only the root
`<version>` leaves the children pointing at a non-existent parent and **fails the reactor build**
(`Could not find artifact net.ladenthin:llama-parent:pom:X.Y.Z`).

`versions:set` only rewrites the **poms**. The **two README files** that carry hardcoded
release-version dependency snippets must be bumped **manually and in the same commit** — miss either
and the published docs point consumers at the previous release. (The `llama-langchain4j/README.md`
snippet was exactly the one forgotten on the `5.0.4 → 5.0.5` bump; it is listed here so it is not
missed again.)

- **`README.md`** (root) — the install snippet, the two classifier-example snippets (default + the
  `<classifier>` template), and the `llama-langchain4j` snippet. The Maven Central **badge**
  auto-pulls the latest released version, so leave it. The **`-SNAPSHOT` line** in the "Snapshot
  builds" section documents the snapshot channel — set it to the *next* dev version, not the release.
  (The per-classifier snippets were **deduplicated** to a single canonical + template pair, so the
  release version now appears in only ~4 spots here, not ~20 — the runtime details live once in the
  classifier table.)
- **`llama-langchain4j/README.md`** — its own `<dependency>` snippet.
- **`llama-android/README.md`** and **`llama-kotlin/README.md`** — their Gradle dependency
  snippets, plus the `llama-android`/`llama-kotlin` snippets in the root README's
  "Importing in Android" section.

(If single-source ergonomics are wanted, the Maven
CI-friendly `${revision}` property + `flatten-maven-plugin` would let a bump touch only the root —
that plugin is not configured today, so do not rely on "root only".)

## LangChain4j integration (`llama-langchain4j` reactor module)

`llama-langchain4j/` adapts a `LlamaModel` to LangChain4j's `ChatModel`,
`StreamingChatModel`, `EmbeddingModel` and `ScoringModel` interfaces **in-process over
JNI** (no HTTP hop). It is a **reactor module** alongside the core `llama` module (see
"Repository layout" above), so it is built, versioned and released together with the core.

Why it is a **separate artifact** and not a classifier of the core: langchain4j 1.x
requires **Java 17** (the core stays Java 8), and classifiers share the core's single POM —
adding `langchain4j-core` there would force it (and the Java 17 floor) on every plain
`net.ladenthin:llama` consumer. A separate `artifactId` (its own module POM) is the only way to
keep that dependency (and Java floor) off the core. It is pure Java with **no per-classifier
matrix**: it compiles against the core's Java API, which is identical across every native
classifier; the backend (CPU/CUDA/OpenCL/Vulkan) is a runtime classpath choice for the
consumer.

Wiring:

1. **`llama-langchain4j/pom.xml`** — `net.ladenthin:llama-langchain4j`, `release 17`, a child of
   `net.ladenthin:llama-parent` (so it **inherits `${project.version}`** — no hardcoded *dependency*
   version, no lockstep guard; the `<parent><version>` literal itself is still bumped in lockstep,
   see "Version bump" above). Depends on `net.ladenthin:llama:${project.version}` and
   `dev.langchain4j:langchain4j-core`. Builds its own sources/javadoc jars; the `release`
   profile (GPG + Central Publishing) is **inherited from the parent**, not duplicated here.
   Java package stays `net.ladenthin.llama.langchain4j` (package name need not track the artifactId).
2. **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — the `test-java-llama-langchain4j` job installs
   parent + core into the local repo (`mvn -pl llama -am -DskipTests install`), then
   `mvn -f llama-langchain4j/pom.xml verify` (7 model-free mapping unit tests run; the 4
   model-backed integration tests self-skip without a GGUF; `verify` also builds the javadoc
   jar so a release-time javadoc break is caught in PR CI). The `publish-snapshot`/
   `publish-release` jobs `needs:` this job; deployment is a **single reactor**
   `mvn -P release deploy` (no separate module deploy step — the parent's inherited `release`
   profile signs and publishes parent + llama + llama-langchain4j together at the same version).
   A separate **`test-java-llama-langchain4j-integration`** job runs the model-backed tests
   (chat/streaming/embedding/scoring adapters) by **reusing** the shared GGUF cache
   (`gguf-models-v1`, restore-only — no extra download) and the `Linux-x86_64-libraries` native
   artifact: it `needs: [crosscompile-linux-x86_64, download-models]` (so the cache is already
   populated and it runs in parallel), installs parent+core with the downloaded native lib
   bundled, and passes the already-cached chat (`REASONING_MODEL_NAME`), nomic-embedding and
   jina-reranker model paths via the module's
   `-Dnet.ladenthin.llama.langchain4j.{embedding,rerank}.model` / `net.ladenthin.llama.model.path`
   properties. It is validation-only (not a release gate); a cold cache degrades to a self-skip.

**Mapped** (since 5.0.6): blocking tool calling (`ToolSpecification` ↔ jllama `ToolDefinition`
via the module's own `JsonSchemaElementSerializer` — langchain4j's serializer lives in its
`internal` package, so the module carries a public-API-only recursive walk emitting the same
`$defs`/`#/$defs/…` conventions; tool-call turns round-trip in both directions),
`response_format`/JSON mode (`json_object` + `json_schema` structured output), and multimodal
user input (`ImageContent`/`AudioContent` → `ContentPart` array-form content; needs `--mmproj`).
Streaming (since 5.0.6, second pass): `JllamaStreamingChatModel` now streams over the native
OAI chunk path via the module's `StreamingChunkAssembler` — streamed tool calls
(`onPartialToolCall`/`onCompleteToolCall` + `toolExecutionRequests()` on the final response),
per-token thinking events (`onPartialThinking` + `AiMessage.thinking()`), real finish reason and
token usage. **Open follow-up** (documented in `llama-langchain4j/README.md`): `modelName()` is
ignored (one model per adapter).

## Android AAR + Kotlin façade (`llama-android/` + `llama-kotlin/`)

Two consumable Android-facing artifacts, replacing the submodule/NDK source-integration flow as
the recommended path (README "Importing in Android", Option 1):

- **`net.ladenthin:llama-android`** / **`llama-android-opencl`** — AARs (`<packaging>aar</packaging>`)
  carrying the core classes + the CI-built `libjllama.so` natives under `jni/` — the CPU AAR is
  **multi-ABI** (`arm64-v8a` devices + `x86_64` emulators/Chromebooks, built by the
  `crosscompile-android-x86_64` dockcross job whose artifact also merges into the default JAR's
  `Linux-Android/x86_64` tree via the `*-libraries` glob; the OpenCL flavor stays arm64-only —
  Adreno is Qualcomm ARM hardware), a
  `minSdkVersion 28` manifest (AGP enforces the floor on consumers), and consumer R8/ProGuard
  rules (`consumer-proguard.txt` → `proguard.txt` in the AAR; keeps `net.ladenthin.llama.**` for
  the JNI `FindClass`/Jackson reflection surface). The AAR's `classes.jar` is the
  **byte-identical Maven-built core jar** minus the desktop/Android native resource trees
  (~70 MB APK bloat otherwise) and `module-info.class` (D8 rejects it); on Android `LlamaLoader`
  resolves via `System.loadLibrary("jllama")`, which finds the AAR-installed `.so` — no loader
  change was needed. Built by the **standalone plain-Gradle build** in `llama-android/`
  (see "Repository layout" for why it is not a Maven module); the POM mirrors the core's
  compile-scope deps (jackson/slf4j-api/jspecify/checker-qual, versions parsed from
  `llama/pom.xml` — deliberately NOT the SLF4J binding, which is the JVM-only runtime dependency).
- **`net.ladenthin:llama-kotlin`** — Maven reactor module; pure-Kotlin (2.4, jvmTarget 1.8)
  coroutines façade: `generateFlow`/`generateChatFlow` (cold `Flow`, source closed on
  completion/error/cancellation) and `completeSuspend`/`chatSuspend`/`chatCompleteTextSuspend`/
  `embedSuspend` (`completeSuspend` wires coroutine cancellation into the cooperative
  `CancellationToken`). The core dep is **provided-scope** so Android consumers pair it with the
  AAR instead of transitively pulling the fat desktop JAR. 6 model-free unit tests fake the
  `Iterable & AutoCloseable` seam (`closeableIterableFlow`/`withCancellationToken` internals).

**16 KB page-size invariant (Google Play, Android 15+ targets):** `llama/CMakeLists.txt` pins
`-Wl,-z,max-page-size=16384` in the Android guard block, and the `package-android-aar` CI job
asserts every LOAD segment of the shipped `.so` is 16384-aligned via `readelf` — a dockcross
toolchain bump cannot silently regress Play compatibility.

**dlopen-ability invariant (bionic-only DT_NEEDED):** the same Android guard block sets
`GGML_OPENMP OFF` (ggml uses its std::thread pool — Android ships no `libomp.so`; same trade
as the Windows-arm64 clang-cl job) and links `-static-libstdc++` (no `libc++_shared.so`
dependency — that runtime only exists when an app packages it itself). Without both, the
dockcross cross-clang emitted `DT_NEEDED` on `libomp.so` + `libc++_shared.so`, which made
`System.loadLibrary("jllama")` fail with `UnsatisfiedLinkError` on every device (caught by the
`test-android-emulator` job; the released 5.0.5 arm64 lib had the same latent defect). The
`package-android-aar` job enforces a per-`.so` `DT_NEEDED` whitelist (`libc.so libm.so libdl.so
liblog.so libandroid.so`, plus `libOpenCL.so` for the OpenCL flavor) via `readelf -dW`, and
`LlamaLoader` now includes the swallowed `System.loadLibrary` message in its
"Directly from .apk/lib (…)" tried-path entry so a future dlopen reason is never invisible.

**CI (`publish.yml`):** `test-java-llama-kotlin` (model-free unit tests);
`package-android-aar` (needs both Android native jobs) builds the core jar, stages the natives,
assembles both AARs, validates structure (entries, minSdk, classes.jar content, 16 KB alignment),
publishes to mavenLocal, and runs the **AGP consumer smoke test** — the minimal app fixture in
`.github/android-consumer-test/` resolves the AAR from mavenLocal and runs a full R8
`assembleRelease` on the runner's preinstalled Android SDK (this is what actually validates
AGP/Android Studio consumption). **On-device runtime IS now CI-covered** via
`test-android-emulator`: a KVM-accelerated x86_64 emulator (API 30) runs the fixture's
`connectedDebugAndroidTest` — `System.loadLibrary` from the AAR's `jni/x86_64`, on-device
`GgufInspector`, and real native inference against the adb-pushed cached draft model
(AMD-Llama-135m). The job is a **release gate** (in both
publish `needs:` graphs) since PR #298, after running flake-free through the PR's validation
cycle. arm64 kernels + the Adreno/OpenCL flavor remain out of emulator scope —
the planned example app covers those on hardware.
Both publish jobs `need` these jobs (fail-loud release gating) and publish the AARs via Gradle:
snapshots to the Central snapshots repo (`publishAllPublicationsToCentralSnapshotsRepository`),
releases as a signed Central Portal bundle upload (staging repo → zip → Publisher API).
`llama-kotlin` rides the normal reactor `mvn -P release deploy`.

## Android app "LLM Service" (`android-llmservice/`)

A shippable, **KISS fully-offline on-device chat app** consuming the `llama-android` AAR +
`llama-kotlin` façade. App label **"LLM Service"**, applicationId/namespace/package
**`net.ladenthin.android.llmservice`**. One Compose screen: pick a GGUF from the file system
(Storage Access Framework), stream a chat reply fully on-device, **tune sampling** via a Settings
sheet (⚙️ — temperature/Top-K/Top-P/Min-P/**repeat penalty**/repeat range/max tokens; the
repeat-penalty default is what stops the small-model repetition loop), **Stop/Copy/Regenerate/Clear**
the chat, watch an **in-app log** (bottom strip + full viewer with copy-all / save-as-`.txt` / clear),
switch UI language via a **flag picker (13 languages)**, and **Save/Load** the conversation to
**private local storage**. No `INTERNET`/storage permission — nothing leaves the device. Like `llama-android/` and
`.github/android-consumer-test/`, it is a **standalone plain-Gradle/AGP build, NOT a Maven
reactor module** (and NOT published to Maven Central — it is an app, not a library). It is the
"real app" counterpart to the headless `.github/android-consumer-test/` fixture (which only
compiles/loads the API); this one has a UI and is driven end-to-end. The name is intentionally
**generic/descriptive** (sidesteps trademark conflicts); the applicationId under the owner's
domain is the only string that must be globally unique.

Structure (mirrors the consumer-test's plumbing):
- **`settings.gradle.kts`** — `rootProject.name = "android-llmservice"`; pins AGP `9.3.0` + the
  Compose compiler plugin (`2.4.10`); `mavenLocal()` first so the freshly-built AAR + façade
  resolve there in CI (Maven Central for real users). Stay at `>= 9.2.1`: `9.2.1` (not `9.2.0`)
  first fixed a real R8 regression (`ClassNotFoundException` on `com.android.tools.r8.RecordTag`
  after upgrading Gradle to 9.x with AGP 9.2.0) that hits this project directly since
  `buildTypes.release` sets `isMinifyEnabled = true`; `9.3.0` carries that fix forward and the
  `.github/android-consumer-test` fixture is pinned the same way. AGP 9.3.x requires Gradle >= 9.5.0
  and JDK 17+; CI already runs JDK 21 everywhere (`env.JAVA_VERSION`), so only the `gradle-version`
  pin on the jobs that build this project (and the `.github/android-consumer-test` fixture)
  needed bumping (9.4.1 → 9.5.0). AGP 9.0+ has **built-in Kotlin support** (a runtime dependency on
  Kotlin Gradle plugin 2.2.10+), so the standalone `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` plugin is no longer
  applied — applying it now fails the build with "no longer required for Kotlin support since
  AGP 9.0" (`app/build.gradle.kts` line 7). The Compose compiler plugin still applies
  separately and its 2.4.10 pin exceeds AGP's 2.2.10 floor, so no other version changed.
- **`app/build.gradle.kts`** — `namespace`/`applicationId` `net.ladenthin.android.llmservice`,
  `minSdk 28` (AAR floor), `compileSdk 37` (raised from 35 — Compose/lifecycle/activity AAR
  metadata now requires it), `targetSdk 35`, Jetpack Compose, `androidx.appcompat` (only for
  the per-app language API), ABIs `arm64-v8a` + `x86_64`. Depends on `net.ladenthin:llama-android` +
  `net.ladenthin:llama-kotlin` at `-PjllamaVersion=<reactor version>` (defaults to the last release
  when built by hand). The release `signingConfig` reads an **upload keystore** (env vars
  `JLLAMA_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE` / `_STORE_PASSWORD` / `_KEY_ALIAS` / `_KEY_PASSWORD`, or the matching `-P`
  props) and **falls back to debug signing** when none is set, so forks/PRs/local builds stay green.
- **i18n:** every UI string is a resource; translations ship for **13 languages**
  (`values-{de,es,fr,it,pt,ru,tr,ar,hi,zh-rCN,ja,ko}/strings.xml` + default English), listed in
  `res/xml/locales_config.xml` and `Languages.kt`. The flag dropdown switches language in-app via
  `AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales` (AppCompat `autoStoreLocales` service persists it;
  `MainActivity` extends `AppCompatActivity`, theme `Theme.LlmService` = AppCompat DayNight). The
  ViewModel survives the locale-change recreation, so the chat isn't lost. `app_name` ("LLM Service")
  is the one string deliberately NOT translated.
- **`ChatViewModel.kt`** — the logic: loads a `LlamaModel` (SAF `content://` copied into `filesDir`
  because llama.cpp mmaps a real path), streams via `generateChatFlow` and forwards the `GenerationSettings`
  sampling knobs to `InferenceParameters`; supports **stop** (`generation?.cancel()` — cancellation keeps
  the partial reply, not an error) and **regenerate** (drop the trailing reply, re-run the last user turn,
  shared `startGeneration` path); keeps a capped rolling in-app **log**. **`SessionStore.kt`** — private
  local save/load: the conversation + model path as JSON in `filesDir/session.json` (`org.json`, no dep
  added), readable only by the app. **`LlmServiceApp.kt`** — `Application` that **wipes the transient
  working data** (the copied model `current-model.gguf` + cache) on every **cold start**
  (`onCreate`) — a privacy guarantee independent of the OS calling `onDestroy`; `MainActivity` also
  wipes best-effort on finish. Only the **opt-in saved session** persists. **`MainActivity.kt`** —
  Compose UI with a **two-row app bar** (row 1 = horizontally-scrollable model name + a ❌ unload
  button when a model is loaded, row 2 = all action icons) + SAF picker + flag menu + Save/Load + the ⚙️ Settings sheet
  (sampling knobs + a **Model** section: CPU threads / context length applied via **Reload model**) +
  the 🧾 log strip/viewer + Stop/Copy/Regenerate/Clear chat actions (+ **long-press any bubble to
  copy**) + **prompt shortcut chips** + a **device-readiness card** (free RAM / storage / battery via
  `DeviceInfo`) on the picker + the offline badge; reads optional `MODEL_PATH` / `CHAT_TEMPLATE`
  intent extras as a **test hook** (the shipping UI never sets them).
- **`app/src/androidTest/kotlin/.../ChatFlowInstrumentedTest.kt`** — the real end-to-end test:
  launches the activity with a preloaded model (bypassing the system SAF dialog, which only
  UiAutomator could drive), types a prompt, taps Send, asserts a non-empty streamed reply.
  Self-skips (JUnit `Assume`) when the adb-pushed model is absent.

**Requirements / roadmap docs (keep in sync with the code).** The app has **no unit tests** for its
logic (only the one on-device `ChatFlowInstrumentedTest` above), so
[`android-llmservice/requirements.md`](android-llmservice/requirements.md) is the **spec of record** —
it enumerates, with stable `Rn.m` IDs, every feature the app implements today. Any change to app
behavior must update `requirements.md` in the same commit (add/amend/retire a row); the roadmap of
not-yet-built features lives in [`android-llmservice/TODO.md`](android-llmservice/TODO.md), and
`README.md`'s feature claims must match `requirements.md`.

**Recommended real model: Gemma 3 4B Instruct** (a `*-it` GGUF; carries its own chat template, so
no override needed). Any instruct GGUF works. The CI on-device test uses the tiny cached draft model
with a forced `chatml` template just to prove tokens generate.

**Key signing fact:** the Maven Central **GPG key cannot sign an APK/AAB** (different
cryptosystem). Android needs a Java keystore (PKCS12/JKS + RSA) **upload key**; Play App Signing
manages the final app-signing key. CI wires it from the optional `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64`
+ password/alias secrets.

**CI wiring** — **two split jobs** in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (both `needs:` the two Android
native jobs; the test job additionally `needs: verify-model-cache`), so the installable artifacts are
**always** produced even when the on-device UI test is flaky/slow:
- **`build-android-llmservice`** — installs the core + `llama-kotlin` to mavenLocal (`llama-kotlin`'s
  core dep is provided-scope, so the desktop JAR is never pulled into the APK), stages the CI-built
  Android natives, publishes the CPU AAR to mavenLocal, builds the **release `.aab`** (signed with the
  upload key when the `ANDROID_UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64` secret is present, else debug-signed) + the
  installable **`.apk`**, and uploads them (`android-llmservice-aab` / `android-llmservice-apk`).
  **No emulator** — a flaky emulator can never block getting the APK.
- **`test-android-llmservice`** — a **separate, non-gating** check that repeats the setup, then boots
  the KVM x86_64 emulator and runs the Compose UI test via **`.github/run-android-llmservice-test.sh`**
  (adb-pushes the cached `AMD-Llama-135m` draft model, `connectedDebugAndroidTest`). It can go **red on
  its own** without stopping the build/artifacts; keep it **non-required** in branch protection to keep
  it optional (visible-but-non-blocking).

Both emulator jobs (`test-android-llmservice` + `test-android-emulator`) prepend a **free-disk step**
before the emulator (delete every restored model except `DRAFT_MODEL_NAME` + large unused preinstalled
toolchains) because the AVD userdata partition needs ~7.4 GB and the full ~10 GB GGUF cache restore
otherwise FATALs the emulator ("Not enough space to create userdata partition"). Neither
llmservice job is **yet a publish gate** (not in the `publish-snapshot`/`publish-release` `needs:`
graphs) so a Compose/AGP version-pin hiccup can't block a library release.
`android-llmservice/**/build/` is git-ignored.

## Dependency Convergence Pinning

`dependencyConvergence` is enabled (maven-enforcer, `llama/pom.xml`). Convention for pinning a
direct-vs-transitive version mismatch in `dependencyManagement`, the
`excludedScopes=[test,provided]` enforcer default gotcha (jspecify/logback-classic here are
pinned defensively because of it — see that file), and merge-discipline guidance are in
[`../workspace/policies/dependency-convergence-pinning.md`](../workspace/policies/dependency-convergence-pinning.md).
