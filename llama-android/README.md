# llama-android

Android AAR packaging of [java-llama.cpp](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/java-llama.cpp):
the `net.ladenthin:llama` Java API plus the CI-built `arm64-v8a` native library, consumable from
any Android project as a normal Maven dependency — no git submodule, no NDK build, no manual
ProGuard rules.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts of your app — that's all.
dependencies {
    implementation("net.ladenthin:llama-android:5.0.6")
    // or, for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs (device must provide an OpenCL ICD):
    // implementation("net.ladenthin:llama-android-opencl:5.0.6")
}
```

- **minSdk 28** (Android 9.0 Pie) — enforced at build time via the AAR manifest.
- **arm64-v8a only** (the only Android ABI this project ships; see the core README).
- **R8/ProGuard safe** — consumer rules ship inside the AAR (`proguard.txt`) and apply
  automatically.
- **16 KB page-size compliant** native library (Google Play requirement for Android 15+ targets).
- The Kotlin coroutines/Flow façade lives in the separate, optional
  [`llama-kotlin`](../llama-kotlin) artifact.

Use `LlamaModel` exactly as on the JVM (see the core README). On Android the loader resolves the
native library via `System.loadLibrary("jllama")` from the APK's native-lib directory — where the
AAR's `jni/arm64-v8a/libjllama.so` lands.

> Do **not** combine this artifact with a `net.ladenthin:llama` JAR dependency in the same app:
> the AAR already contains those classes (and only the Android native library, whereas the JAR
> would drag ~70 MB of desktop natives into your APK as Java resources).

Models are ordinary GGUF files on device storage; download them at runtime (or bundle small ones
as assets and copy them to files dir) and pass the absolute path to `ModelParameters.setModel`.

## Two AAR flavors

| Artifact | Backend | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| `llama-android` | CPU | any arm64-v8a device, API 28+ |
| `llama-android-opencl` | OpenCL (Adreno-tuned kernels) | device OpenCL ICD (`libOpenCL.so`) — Qualcomm Adreno drivers ship one; devices without an ICD must use the CPU flavor |

## How this build works

This directory is a **standalone plain-Gradle build** (no Android Gradle Plugin, no Android SDK
required to build): an AAR is a documented zip, and Gradle's built-in `maven-publish` can publish
it with `<packaging>aar</packaging>` — which plain Maven cannot (`android-maven-plugin` is
unmaintained). It is intentionally *not* a Maven reactor module, but it stays version-locked to
the reactor: `build.gradle.kts` parses the version (and the mirrored dependency versions) out of
the Maven poms at configure time, so `mvn versions:set` remains the single bump point.

The AAR's `classes.jar` repackages the **byte-identical Maven-built core classes** (no
recompilation) minus the bundled desktop native resources and `module-info.class`; the Android
`.so` ships under `jni/arm64-v8a/` instead of as a Java resource.

### Building locally

```bash
# 1. Build the core jar (from the repo root)
mvn -pl llama -am -DskipTests package

# 2. Stage the Android native libraries (CI artifacts, or a dockcross build):
#    natives/cpu/arm64-v8a/libjllama.so
#    natives/opencl/arm64-v8a/libjllama.so

# 3. Assemble + publish to the local staging repo / mavenLocal
gradle -p llama-android aarCpu aarOpencl
gradle -p llama-android publishToMavenLocal
```

CI (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) assembles both AARs from the freshly built native
artifacts, asserts the AAR structure and the 16 KB LOAD-segment alignment, and compiles a
minimal AGP consumer app against the published AAR as a smoke test.
