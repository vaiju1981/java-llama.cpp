# TODO — java-llama.cpp

Open work items for this repo. Cross-cutting tracking lives in
[`../workspace/crossrepostatus.md`](../workspace/crossrepostatus.md);
items here are jllama-specific or are this repo's slice of a
cross-cutting initiative.

## Open — jllama-specific

### LlamaLoader extraction-directory isolation (optional follow-up, low priority)

Left over from the 2026-06-20 code audit (18/18 findings fixed in PRs #258/#260, regression tests in
#261/#262 — see the Done section): full per-process extraction **directory** isolation + a `cleanup()`
that recursively removes dead-process dirs. Since extraction writes are atomic and content-checked,
this is a tidiness improvement (stops the shared-tmpdir `cleanup()` racing a live peer's flat file),
not a correctness fix — and it needs Windows locked-file co-design.

### OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint — open follow-ups (Java transport; deprioritized)

The `OpenAiCompatServer` surface itself is shipped (routes, protocol translations, integration
round-trips — see CLAUDE.md "Two server modes"). **Owner priority: the native-transport
`NativeServer` comes first; Java-transport-only items below are deliberately deprioritized.**

- **Streaming raw-completion remainder:** (a) streaming `POST /v1/completions` is DONE; remaining are
  (b) token-streaming Ollama `/api/generate` (translate `text_completion` chunks to NDJSON, mirroring
  the chat→Ollama translator) and (c) Continue's native `POST /completion` route in the llama.cpp-native
  streaming shape (`{"content":…,"stop":…}` per chunk). Java-only server wiring.
- **Future *output* modalities (audio / image) — design note, not yet actionable.** llama.cpp's server
  produces text (plus embeddings/rerank) only; the integration points are isolated (a new
  `OpenAiBackend.stream*` primitive + `OpenAiSseFormatter.*Chunk` per modality). Two future hooks:
  OuteTTS behind an `/v1/audio/speech`-style route; proxying image/audio generation to an external
  model. Keep chunk formatters modality-neutral.
- **Incremental tool-call streaming on the alternative surfaces.** Ollama/Anthropic/Responses emit each
  tool call whole at end-of-stream (`ToolCallDeltaAccumulator`); revisit only if a client needs
  incremental `input_json_delta` / `function_call_arguments.delta` fidelity.
- **Per-model FIM template registry** — only needed if `/v1/completions`-with-`suffix` FIM is exposed;
  `/infill` applies the model's FIM tokens server-side, so low value.
- **Multi-model registry (Java transport).** The native surface has this via router mode +
  `RouterClient`; the Java `OpenAiCompatServer` still advertises/serves a single model id.
- **Manual real-client validation.** Server-side round-trips exist for every surface; what remains is
  pointing the actual editor clients (Copilot Ollama provider / Custom Endpoint, Claude Code, a
  Responses client) at a running server, since round-trips confirm wire shapes but not each client's
  parser.

### SonarCloud "Security Rating on New Code" gate — PR #248 (open)

The PR's **only** red is SonarCloud's "Security Rating on New Code" gate (every build/test job is
green; SonarCloud is **not** a merge-blocking build job). The findings are GitHub-Actions/Java
analyzer issues from the Maven scanner — **"C" is the rating *grade* (A–E), not the C language**;
there is no CFamily/C-C++ scan configured. Addressed:

- **`clang-format.yml`** — `pip install` without `--only-binary :all:` can run a package's `setup.py`;
  forced wheels-only (`84297e0`, block scalar so `:all:` doesn't break YAML). *If Sonar still flags it,
  try the `--only-binary=:all:` equals form.*
- **`osv-scanner.yml` / `scorecard.yml`** — top-level `permissions: read-all` → `contents: read`
  (`84297e0`); safe because every job in both files already declares its own exact permissions.
- **`publish.yml`** — workflow-level `permissions: contents: read` (Sonar wants it per-job); **owner
  marked it Accept/"Won't fix" on the dashboard** rather than spreading perms across ~25 release jobs.
  Alternative if ever desired: add `permissions: contents: read` to the ~19 read-only jobs (the 5
  publish/report jobs already declare `contents: write`) and drop the top-level block.
- **`PairTest.java`** — 3 Critical *Reliability* bugs (`assertNotNull` on the primitive `hashCode()`)
  replaced with a determinism check (`9f0d377`). Reliability rating, **not** the Security gate.

**Still open:** the gate was still red as of `9f0d377`. SonarCloud's issues API is auth-gated (403 from
CI), so the exact remaining new-code Vulnerability must be read off the dashboard. Resolve the last
finding, accept it on the dashboard, or merge on the green build/test checks.

### License Compliance (FOSSA-style dependency-license gate) — PR #248 (open)

Separate from the FSFE **REUSE** check (which is green — `reuse lint` reports 266/266 files compliant)
and from SonarCloud: the PR's combined commit status shows a **"License Compliance" check failing with
"17 issues found"** (an error-state commit status posted by a license-scanner GitHub App, not a
workflow in `.github/workflows/`). It contributes to the `mergeable_state: blocked` on #248.

- **Almost certainly pre-existing**, not introduced by this PR: #248 changes **no dependencies** (the
  `pom.xml` edit only adds the `windows-ninja` build profile), so the 17 are dependency-license policy
  findings already present on `main` (e.g. GPL-2.0 carried by the llama.cpp sources).
- **Not yet inspected** — the scanner's dashboard/host is outside this sandbox's egress allowlist, same
  as `sonarcloud.io`. To triage: open the check's details link from the PR (or allowlist the host), read
  the 17 findings, then accept policy-OK licenses on the dashboard or adjust the policy. Confirm whether
  it is a *required* status (if so it blocks merge; if advisory it does not).
- **Still red on PR #298 (2026-07-05):** the same status ("17 issues found") posts on every head there
  too and contributes to its `mergeable_state: blocked`. Same triage path: read the findings on the
  scanner's dashboard, accept policy-OK licenses or adjust the policy.

### Upstream PR submissions — drop the carried patches (open)

Six of the eight `patches/` are upstream-submittable verbatim; each accepted PR (once the pin is
bumped past it) deletes a patch from the bump checklist. (`0003`/`0004` are carries of already-open
upstream PRs #22393/#23116 — they drop automatically when those merge.)

- **`0001` Windows arg-parse embed guard** (against #24779): `common_params_parse` trusts the caller's
  argv; `common_params_parse_main()` keeps the standalone tools' UTF-8 recovery. Ship with the
  standalone-safe repro (synthetic argv discarded on Windows because `GetCommandLineW()` returns the
  host process line).
- **`0002` preserve caller load-progress callback** (b9789 regression: server clobbers
  `params_base.load_progress_callback`).
- **`0005` recurrent near-prompt-end checkpoints** (agentic checkpoint starvation on recurrent/hybrid
  models; complements upstream #24035/#24899/#24891).
- **`0006` embeddable `llama_server`** (no process signal handlers, forwarded-argv parse, out-of-band
  shutdown).
- **`0007` `llama_server_attach`** (HTTP frontend on an existing `server_context`).
- **`0008` `LLAMA_SERVER_WORKER_CMD` router worker override** (also useful for containerized/wrapped
  deployments).

### llama.cpp upstream feature exposure (queued, deferred by policy)

These are JNI plumbing items for upstream API additions. Policy: add only after a real user request — they are mostly relevant to specific model families or specialized workflows.

- **Expose `--spec-draft-backend-sampling` toggle via `ModelParameters.setSpecDraftBackendSampling(boolean)`.** Added in b9437 (env `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DRAFT_BACKEND_SAMPLING`). Backend sampling for the speculative draft is enabled by default upstream but auto-disabled on `LLAMA_SPLIT_MODE_TENSOR` setups; an explicit Java-side setter lets callers force-disable it for benchmarking or for backends with sampler bugs. Speculative-decoding power users.

- **Expose runtime reasoning control via `InferenceParameters.setReasoningControl(boolean)` + `LlamaModel.endReasoning(...)`.** Added in b9444–b9490: new `common_params_sampling::reasoning_control` flag arms the budget sampler so reasoning can be ended at runtime, and new `common_sampler_reasoning_budget_force(common_sampler *)` triggers the end-of-thinking token injection on the next sample. Upstream also adds a `POST /v1/chat/completions/control` server endpoint accepting `{"id": "...", "action": "reasoning_end"}`. Java mapping would be: (a) `InferenceParameters.setReasoningControl(boolean)` arms the sampler on the inference run, (b) a new `LlamaModel.endReasoning(int slotId)` (or per-streaming-task-id) JNI method calls the upstream `common_sampler_reasoning_budget_force` against the slot's sampler. Useful for interactive UIs that want a "skip thinking and answer now" button. Relevant only for reasoning-trained models (DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3-Thinking, GPT-OSS-Reasoner, etc.).

- **Expose `llama_context_params::n_outputs_max` via `ModelParameters.setMaxOutputs(int)`.** Added in b9444–b9490 (default `-1` = derived from `n_batch`). Caps the number of output slots allocated per context; relevant for memory-constrained setups that always run with `logits_all=false` and want to prevent over-allocation when `n_batch` is large. Trivial JNI plumbing (one `cparams` field passthrough); add when a user reports OOM on context creation tied to output slot pre-allocation.

- **Expose Multi-Token Prediction toggle via `ModelParameters.setMtp(boolean)`.** Existed since the Qwen3.5 MTP work; b9444–b9490 extends it to Step-3.5. CLI flags `--mtp`/`--no-mtp` (env `LLAMA_ARG_MTP`) control whether the draft head runs alongside the main model for accelerated decoding. Java setter would route to `common_params_speculative::type = COMMON_SPECULATIVE_TYPE_DRAFT_MTP`. Relevant only for MTP-trained models.

- **Expose `llama_vocab::get_suppress_tokens()` via `LlamaModel.getSuppressTokens()`.** Added in b9490–b9495 alongside the new `tokenizer.ggml.suppress_tokens` GGUF key and the `LLM_KV_TOKENIZER_SUPPRESS_TOKENS` constant. When a GGUF declares this array, upstream stores it on `llama_vocab::impl::suppress_tokens` and exposes it via the new `llama_vocab::get_suppress_tokens()` accessor. The bias is **applied automatically** inside the model forward graph — the Gemma4 Unified graph (`src/models/gemma4.cpp`) reads the list and adds a `-INFINITY` logit bias to those token IDs via a new `llm_graph_input_logits_bias` input so the model cannot emit them (used to block `<image|>` / `<audio|>` placeholders). A Java mirror would be `public int[] getSuppressTokens()` on `LlamaModel`: a read-only inspector returning the suppression list for debugging or for callers running their own sampling who want to replicate the same bias. Value is low (the bias is auto-applied, Java callers cannot change it; java-llama.cpp does not expose custom logit-bias hooks at this level); cost is trivial (one JNI passthrough + a `getSuppressTokens()` Java method).

### JNI safety and server hardening (from PR #251 contributor)

Raised by [@vaiju1981](https://github.com/vaiju1981) in
[PR #251 comment](https://github.com/bernardladenthin/java-llama.cpp/pull/251#issuecomment-4761363838).
Feel free to contribute fixes — PRs welcome.

- **Unhandled C++ exceptions cross the JNI boundary → JVM abort (UB).** Any `std::exception`
  (or worse, an exception of unknown type) that escapes a native method and crosses the JNI
  boundary causes undefined behaviour on most JVMs and typically aborts the process. Each native
  method in `jllama.cpp` should wrap its body in `try { … } catch (const std::exception& e) {
  env->ThrowNew(llamaExceptionClass, e.what()); return <zero>; } catch (...) { env->ThrowNew(…,
  "unknown C++ exception"); return <zero>; }` so that errors surface as `LlamaException` on the
  Java side instead of crashing the JVM.

- **`parse_string_array` — null deref + JNI local-reference leak.** The helper that reads a
  JSON string array from JNI can dereference a null pointer when an array element is absent,
  and leaks JNI local references when an early exit skips the matching `DeleteLocalRef`. Fix:
  guard every `GetObjectArrayElement` result and pair each reference acquisition with a
  `DeleteLocalRef` before the next iteration or return.

- **`close()` / native `delete()` double-free under concurrent close.** If two threads race to
  call `LlamaModel.close()`, both can reach the native `delete` path and free the same
  `jllama_context` pointer twice → heap corruption. Fix: use `AtomicBoolean closed` + a
  `synchronized` guard (or `compareAndSet`) on the Java side so `close()` is idempotent and
  the native pointer is nulled before the second caller can reach it.

- **`ServerMetrics.getCumulativeTimings()` truncation — STALE / REFUTED.** This claim was
  verified false: `getCumulativeTimings` reads `n_prompt_tokens_processed_total` /
  `n_tokens_predicted_total` via `asLong(0L)` into `long` fields and constructs a `Timings`
  with `long promptN` / `predictedN` (`ServerMetrics.java` / `Timings.java`) — no int cast
  occurs. The real token-count truncation (now fixed) lived in the protocol shims
  (`ResponsesStreamTranslator`, `AnthropicStreamTranslator`, `ResponsesApiSupport`,
  `AnthropicApiSupport`, `OllamaApiSupport`, `ChatResponseParser.extractUsageField`), which used
  `.asInt(0)`; those now use `.asLong(0L)` so sessions above ~2.1B tokens no longer overflow.

- **Unbounded request-body read → OOM DoS.** The HTTP handler reads the entire request body
  into a `String`/`byte[]` before parsing it, with no size cap. A client that streams a
  multi-gigabyte body can exhaust heap memory and crash the JVM. Fix: add a configurable
  `maxRequestBodyBytes` limit (e.g. default 4 MB) and reject oversized requests with
  `HTTP 413 Content Too Large` before buffering them.

### Feature backlog from similar projects (remainder: jbang example)

The consolidated investigation lives in
[`docs/feature-investigation-similar-projects.md`](docs/feature-investigation-similar-projects.md)
(18 candidates across the 5 pure-Java sibling runtimes + llamacpp4j, with effort sizing). Everything
high-value from it has shipped — README system-properties table, per-run timing line
(`TimingsLogger`), UTF-8 boundary safety (native `utf8_to_jstring_impl` path), runtime LoRA control,
typed batch embeddings, in-JVM router mode, in-JVM GGUF quantization, GGUF metadata inspector,
session fork/rewind (see the Done section). **Remaining:**

- **jbang single-file example** (XS-S): a `//DEPS net.ladenthin:llama` one-file runnable demo so new
  users can try the binding without a Maven project.
- Further per-repo unique findings in the doc can be pulled on demand; none is currently prioritized.

### Android example app (own session; the remaining Android item)

The AAR + Kotlin façade + multi-ABI (arm64-v8a/x86_64) + emulator CI shipped, and the emulator job is
a release gate (see the Done section / CLAUDE.md "Android AAR + Kotlin façade"). Remaining: a minimal
sample app under e.g. `examples/android-sample/` (single Activity, model picker, streaming text view)
consuming `net.ladenthin:llama-android` + `llama-kotlin` — it validates what the emulator cannot:
real arm64 hardware and the Adreno/OpenCL flavor. Treat LLaMAndroid as prior art.

### GraalVM Native Image evaluation

- **Evaluate GraalVM Native Image as an alternative distribution target.** Reference: [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/). The pure-Java sibling projects in the README's "Similar Projects" list (mukel's `llama3.java` / `gemma4.java` / `gptoss.java` / `qwen35.java` / `nemotron3.java`) demonstrate that single-jar, no-JNI Java inference is viable for individual model architectures. Native Image opens an orthogonal direction for THIS project: AOT-compile the Java layer + JNI bridge to a self-contained binary that bundles the libjllama.so (or per-OS equivalent) and starts in milliseconds without a JVM, which would make jllama usable in CLI tools, serverless functions, and short-lived processes where JVM startup is the dominant cost.

  **What to investigate before committing**:
  - **JNI-loading shape.** Native Image supports JNI but requires `--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED` + reflection/JNI configuration files (`reflect-config.json`, `jni-config.json`, `resource-config.json`) describing every class/method/field reachable across the JNI boundary. The 17 native methods in `jllama.cpp` plus the JNI-side `FindClass` / `GetFieldID` / `GetMethodID` calls at `JNI_OnLoad` need to be mapped. The GraalVM tracing agent (`-agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=...`) can auto-generate the config during a representative test run, but the `LlamaLoader` JAR-extraction path needs at least one resource-config rule for `net/ladenthin/llama/{OS}/{ARCH}/lib*.so`.
  - **Native-library packaging.** The current `LlamaLoader` extracts the OS-specific `.so`/`.dll`/`.dylib` from the JAR to a tmp dir at first use. Native Image needs the same file at AOT-execution time, so either (a) ship the native lib alongside the produced binary as a sidecar file and adjust `LlamaLoader` to find it on the same directory, or (b) embed the native lib as a resource and keep the existing extract-to-tmpdir flow (which Native Image supports via `resource-config.json`).
  - **CUDA / Metal / OpenCL backend selection.** Today the choice between CPU-only / `cuda13-linux-x86-64` / `opencl-android-aarch64` JARs is at Maven-classifier time. Native Image would need either one binary per backend (multiplying the release matrix) or a runtime selector inside `LlamaLoader` that picks among bundled backend libs. The latter is a bigger refactor.
  - **Startup-time benchmark to justify the work.** Measure cold-start of a current java-llama.cpp `LlamaModel(new ModelParameters().setModel("...").setNPredict(1))` invocation: how much is JVM startup + class load vs JNI load + model parse + tokenize + 1 token? If JVM startup is < 10 % of cold-start, Native Image yields little. If JVM startup is > 50 %, it's a clear win for CLI / serverless use cases.
  - **Maintenance cost.** Native Image adds a second build matrix (per OS × per backend × per JDK) and a new failure surface (Native Image config drift when a llama.cpp version bump adds new JNI-reachable types). Should ship only with a CI job that exercises the Native Image build on at least one OS, otherwise the config files will rot silently.

  **Out of scope until evidence supports it**: actually implementing any of the above. This entry exists so that when someone asks "can I ship java-llama.cpp as a single 30 MB binary?" the answer points to a concrete investigation plan rather than restarting from zero.

## Open — cross-cutting (slice for this repo)

- **jqwik pin policy** — see [`../workspace/policies/jqwik-prompt-injection.md`](../workspace/policies/jqwik-prompt-injection.md). `jqwik.version ≤ 1.9.3` is mandatory.

- **`@VisibleForTesting` audit.** No usages currently. Walk the production tree for package-private/protected methods or fields that exist purely so tests can reach them, and either annotate (`com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting`) or move into the test source tree.

- **Null-safety refinement.** JSpecify + NullAway are now enforced at compile time in **strict JSpecify mode** with the extra options `CheckOptionalEmptiness`, `AcknowledgeRestrictiveAnnotations`, `AcknowledgeAndroidRecent`, `AssertsEnabled` (see `pom.xml`); `@NullMarked` on the three packages via `package-info.java`; JDK module exports in `.mvn/jvm.config`. The legacy `org.jetbrains.annotations` dep has been removed; all nullability annotations are JSpecify. Public-API methods that may legitimately have no value use `Optional<T>` rather than `@Nullable T` (`ChatResponse.getFirstMessage`, `ChatMessage.getParts`, `ChatRequest.buildToolsJson`). Open follow-up: review remaining unannotated public API surfaces for places where `@Nullable` would be more precise than the implicit non-null default.

- **SpotBugs `effort=Max` + `threshold=Low`** — **DONE (already enabled in `pom.xml`)**, with fb-contrib +
  findsecbugs, bound to `verify`. The legacy "flip the pom / ~65 findings" note is stale: only a handful
  of unexcluded findings remain at any time, and `spotbugs:check` is kept green. Most recent pass fixed the
  6 introduced by the audit Tier-1–3 fixes — `withScalar` uses a single `instanceof Number` (no
  `ITC_INHERITANCE_TYPE_CHECKING`); `ChatMessage.getToolCalls` returns a fresh unmodifiable view (no
  `EI_EXPOSE_REP`); the `LlamaModel` batch methods' deliberate re-throw and the `ChatMessage` public
  constructor's `List` param carry narrow `<Match>` rationale suppressions.
  **Note:** `spotbugs:check` is bound to the `verify` phase, which the model-backed CI test jobs
  (`mvn test` / `mvn package`) do not reach — run `mvn verify` (or a dedicated job) to gate it in CI.

- **Drop the project-wide `OPM_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_METHOD` suppression in
  `spotbugs-exclude.xml`** once the package-architecture refactor lands
  (see [`../workspace/crossrepostatus.md`](../workspace/crossrepostatus.md)
  under "Affects BAF + jllama (multi-package repos)"). The single-root
  package today makes every "method called only by same-package callers
  → could be package-private" finding correct-but-unstable; once layers
  split, cross-layer calls will need public. Snapshot at suppression
  (`07109cc`): 25 sites. The same rule is suppressed in BAF
  (`52c8c95`) for identical reasons.

- **Additional ArchUnit rules to consider** — the full **`layeredArchitecture()`** rule and a **per-module banned-import** rule (`jacksonBannedFromContractsAndLoader` — Jackson kept out of `args`/`callback`/`exception`/`loader`) are now DONE. Still open: more per-module banned-imports if useful, public-API-surface constraints (no public mutable static state, etc.). Partial progress: `7b6667d` covers the "no public field that is not final" sub-rule.

- **Cross-repo code-quality TODOs** — see [`../workspace/policies/code-quality-todos.md`](../workspace/policies/code-quality-todos.md) for the canonical `@VisibleForTesting` design-fit review, package hierarchy review, and class/method naming review. This repo has no `@VisibleForTesting` usages today; package and naming reviews remain open.

## Done (kept for history)

### 2026-07-05 feature wave (PR #298) + follow-ups

One-liners for the sections removed from "Open" (full detail: PR #298, CLAUDE.md, git history):

- **NativeServer attach mode** — `NativeServer(LlamaModel, String...)` via `patches/0007`
  (`llama_server_attach`); serves an already-loaded model over the full upstream HTTP frontend.
- **Typed router API** — `server.RouterClient` + `value.RouterModel` + parser; router mode in-JVM via
  `patches/0008` + `NativeServer.setWorkerCommand`.
- **GGUF metadata inspector** — pure-Java `GgufInspector` + `value.GgufMetadata` (LE/BE, fail-loud).
- **Session fork/rewind** — `Session.checkpoint/rewind/fork` + `value.SessionCheckpoint`.
- **LangChain4j v1 + streaming** — tool calling, JSON mode, multimodal; streamed tool calls +
  per-token thinking via `StreamingChunkAssembler`.
- **UTF-8 JNI path, runtime LoRA control, typed batch embeddings, in-JVM quantizer** (first batches).
- **Android AAR + Kotlin façade + x86_64 ABI + emulator CI** — incl. the dlopen fix (`GGML_OPENMP OFF`
  + `-static-libstdc++`, DT_NEEDED whitelist; also fixed the latent 5.0.5 arm64 defect); emulator job
  promoted to a release gate; committed audio fixture (`audios/sample.wav`) wired as the
  `AudioInputIntegrationTest` default.
- **PIT gate hermeticity** — verified 295/295, 0 NO_COVERAGE with no fixtures; stale gotcha removed.
- **llama.cpp b9870 → b9873 → b9876** — all 8 patches re-verified each step.
- **Windows native classifiers (Ninja default flip + MSVC classifier + CUDA/Vulkan/OpenCL)** — shipped
  earlier; docs live in CLAUDE.md "Windows native classifiers".
- **b9739 Windows JNI arg-parse regression** — fixed via `patches/0001`; upstream submission tracked
  in "Upstream PR submissions" above.
- **Code audit (18 findings)** — fixed in PRs #258/#260 (+ tests #261/#262); only the optional
  extraction-directory isolation remains (own section above).
- **Branch protection aarch64 check rename** — closed as a no-op per owner.


### b9739 upgrade + PR #248 (Windows Ninja, native aarch64, patches mechanism)

- **llama.cpp b9682 → b9739** (#247, merged) + build fixes: `server-schema.cpp` added to the
  `jllama_test` sources (b9739 link fix, `38be6db`); `test_server.cpp` `ParamsFromJsonCmpl`
  expectations updated to b9739 schema behavior (`aaba886`).
- **Windows Ninja artifact** — `ninja-windows` classifier JAR built with Ninja Multi-Config + sccache,
  shipped alongside the permanent MSVC default; both build + Java-test jobs green (`e113ed3`,
  `48f0863`). (See the open section above for the design rationale; verification is done.)
- **Linux aarch64 → native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` build** (`ed9ecbb`). The dockcross `linux-arm64-lts`
  image (GCC 8.5 / glibc 2.17) could no longer compile b9739's C++17 CTAD-in-`new`; now builds natively
  with GCC 14 (mirroring upstream), runs `ctest` on real ARM (446 tests green), and warms sccache
  (99.66% hits). Trade-off: glibc floor 2.17 → ~2.39 (same envelope as upstream's ARM binaries);
  documented in the README classifier table. `build.sh` sccache auto-fetch generalized to aarch64.
- **Generic `patches/` mechanism** — drop `*.patch`/`*.diff` in repo-root `patches/`, applied to the
  FetchContent'd llama.cpp source by `cmake/apply-llama-patches.cmake` via the llama.cpp
  `PATCH_COMMAND` (cross-platform, idempotent, fail-loud). Covers every C++ build from one place.
  First patch fixes the Windows JNI arg-parse regression (`1d875b1` → deterministic form `f651b53`).
  REUSE annotated via `patches/**` glob (`0cffac1`).
- **CUDA sccache verified** — the `manylinux_2_28 (CUDA)` job caches all gcc C/C++ TUs (247/248 hits,
  99.60%); the nvcc `.cu` kernels remain uncached (sccache limitation), and `CUDA_FAST_BUILD` keeps
  PR/validation runs single-arch. (Doc/observation; no code change.)

### Layered package restructure (flat root package → layered hierarchy)

The flat `net.ladenthin.llama` root package was split (via `git mv`, history
preserved) into layered packages so boundaries align with the layers, enforced
by a new `layeredArchitecture()` ArchUnit rule (Api → Loader → Marshalling →
Foundation):

- **Foundation**: `value` (18 DTOs: ChatMessage, ContentPart, Pair, LlamaOutput,
  …), `callback` (CancellationToken, LoadProgressCallback, ToolHandler),
  `exception` (LlamaException, ModelUnavailableException), `args` (existing leaf).
- **Marshalling**: `json` (response parsers + `TimingsLogger`, its only consumer),
  `parameters` (Inference/Model/Json/Cli parameters + `ParameterJsonSerializer` +
  `ChatRequest`).
- **Loader** (internal, NOT exported): `loader` (LlamaLoader, OSInfo,
  ProcessRunner, NativeLibraryPermissionSetter, Java8CompatibilityHelper,
  OfflineModelGuard, LlamaSystemProperties).
- **Api** (root): LlamaModel, Session, LlamaIterable, LlamaIterator.

Cycle-breaking moves: `TimingsLogger` root→`json`, `ParameterJsonSerializer`
`json`→`parameters`, `ChatRequest` root→`parameters` (it carries an
`InferenceParameters` customizer). Test classes mirrored into their subjects'
packages; cross-layer members promoted to `public`. Cross-package Javadoc
`{@link}` references fully-qualified (palantir's `removeUnusedImports` strips
javadoc-only imports). `module-info` exports the new public-API packages and
keeps `loader` internal. All 11 ArchUnit rules green; `javadoc:jar` clean.

**Breaking change**: public-API FQNs changed (e.g. `net.ladenthin.llama.ChatMessage`
→ `net.ladenthin.llama.value.ChatMessage`) — ship under a major version bump.

- **Reactive `LlamaPublisher` removed in favour of consumer-side adapters.**
  The hand-rolled `LlamaPublisher` + `LlamaModel.streamPublisher` /
  `streamChatPublisher` (shipped in PR #188 as §2.3 of the Kotlin SDK
  feature comparison) had zero non-test callers. `LlamaIterable` is
  already `Iterable<LlamaOutput> & AutoCloseable`, and every mainstream
  reactive library wraps it in a few lines via its own resource-management
  primitive (`Flux.using`, `Flowable.using`, Kotlin `use {}`). The real-world
  Android consumer [LLaMAndroid](https://github.com/Rattlyy/LLaMAndroid)
  already uses `LlamaIterable` inside a Kotlin `flow {}` block — bypassing
  the publisher entirely. README "Reactive integration" section documents
  the Reactor / RxJava 3 / Kotlin Flow / Akka patterns; correctness is
  pinned end-to-end by a new `ReactorIntegrationTest` using
  test-scope `reactor-core` (zero runtime deps added; `org.reactivestreams`
  runtime dep dropped). Cleared 6 fb-contrib Max+Low findings on
  `LlamaPublisher$LlamaSubscription` as a side effect.

- **Error Prone bug-pattern promotions to `ERROR`** — `855f447` (12 patterns promoted; `-Xlint:all` enabled).
- **`javac -Werror` + `-Xlint:all,-serial,-options,-classfile,-processing`** — `3e2efbb`. ~20 EP warnings addressed first (EqualsGetClass on `Pair` via instanceof; MissingOverride on `PoolingType` / `RopeScalingType`; JdkObsolete `LinkedList` → `ArrayList` in `LlamaLoader`; StringSplitter inline-suppressed; 3× StringCaseLocaleUsage `Locale.ROOT` in `OSInfo`; EmptyCatch in `OSInfo.isAlpineLinux`; FutureReturnValueIgnored in `LlamaModel.completeAsync`; Finalize on `LlamaModel.finalize`; MixedMutabilityReturnType in 4 parser methods; EnumOrdinal in `InferenceParameters.setMiroStat`; EscapedEntity in `InferenceParameters` javadoc; 4× TypeParameterUnusedInFormals; AnnotateFormatMethod on `Java8CompatibilityHelper.formatted`; SafeVarargs + varargs on `Java8CompatibilityHelper.listOf`).
- **`-parameters` javac arg** — `4350cf2`.
- **`--release N`** — `4350cf2` (`<release>8</release>`).
- **Mutation-testing threshold enforcement (PIT)** — `62f8a00` + `bb93a8f` (docs) + `3bfa51f` (README badge). Runs every CI build with `<mutationThreshold>100</mutationThreshold>`. **Scope expanded 2026-06-07** from the original single `Pair` target (which was stale after the restructure — `llama.Pair`→`value.Pair` matched nothing) to `value.*` + `exception.*` + `args.*` + `json.TimingsLogger` = 27 classes / 163 mutations, all killed. Still open (optional): `json.ChatResponseParser` / `CompletionResponseParser` private-helper survivors (`RerankResponseParser` is excluded — equivalent empty-list mutant).
- **Checker Framework as a second static-nullness pass** — `c63870b`. The original
  `@PolyNull` on `JsonParameters.toJsonString` was simplified to plain `@Nullable`
  (the only `@PolyNull` site in production; eliminated in a later cleanup).
  Native-method constructor calls in `LlamaModel` carry
  `@SuppressWarnings("method.invocation")` (Checker's `@UnderInitialization`
  cannot see that the native callee does not dereference `this`); `Pair.equals`
  and `Usage.equals` declare `@Nullable Object`; `LlamaSystemProperties` getters
  return `@Nullable String`; `getPackage()` and resource-stream null derefs are
  guarded.
- **JPMS `module-info.java` with module-level `@NullMarked`** — `0fd066a` + `9528e79`. The module `net.ladenthin.llama` exports the three hand-written public packages (`net.ladenthin.llama`, `.args`, `.json`). Two-execution `maven-compiler-plugin` pattern; module-level `@NullMarked` lives on the module descriptor.
- **Banned-API enforcement** — Maven Enforcer (`8baae0c`), ArchUnit `System.exit` / `new Random` / `Thread.sleep` (`329d764`), `sun.*` / `com.sun.*` / `jdk.internal.*` (`e6069da`).
- **ArchUnit public-fields-final** — `7b6667d`.
- **LogCaptor smoke test** — `LoggingSmokeTest` (`3cedc6e`).
- **Offline / air-gapped model loading** — `ModelFlag.OFFLINE` + `ModelParameters.setOffline(boolean)` + `hasFlag` helper + public `ModelUnavailableException` (extends now-public `LlamaException`) + deterministic pre-check `OfflineModelGuard`. Unit tests in `LlamaModelOfflineTest`. No JNI rebuild required. *(Originally shipped as `SKIP_DOWNLOAD`/`setSkipDownload` over a parse-failure heuristic; reworked when llama.cpp b9803 removed `common_params::skip_download` and `common_skip_download_exception` — `--skip-download` was never a registered upstream arg, so it never actually skipped a download. `--offline` is the real upstream flag with the intended load-from-cache semantics.)*
- **`LlamaSystemProperties` registry cleanup** — `getLibName()` deleted (`6bb63e1` upstream forensic trace); `OSInfo.getArchName()` now routes through `LlamaSystemProperties.getOsinfoArchitecture()` (`3ae6c81`).
