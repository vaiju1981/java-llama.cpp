and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
from version 5.0.0 onward. Pre-fork releases (`1.x`–`4.2.0`) were authored by
[`kherud/java-llama.cpp`](https://github.com/kherud/java-llama.cpp).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.0).
- `docs/RELEASE.md` capturing the maintainer-facing release procedure (moved out of CHANGELOG).
- OpenSSF Best Practices badge (project 12862) on README.

### Changed
- Unified `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md` structure with sibling repositories in the project family.
- Reconciled Java baseline to **11+** across `pom.xml`, README badge, `CLAUDE.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- README license badge corrected from "Apache 2.0" to "MIT" (matches `LICENSE` file and `pom.xml`).
- `pom.xml` SCM URL: `tree/master` → `tree/main` (default branch renamed).
- Upgraded llama.cpp from b9151 to b9172.

### Added
- Reasoning-budget tests (Qwen3-0.6B).

## [5.0.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- `InferenceParameters.setContinueFinalMessage(boolean)` for the vLLM/transformers-compatible prefill-assistant heuristic (llama.cpp b9134+).
- Tests for `setContinueFinalMessage`.
- Comprehensive Javadoc on public APIs (PR #129).
- Maven Central badge on README (PR #130).

### Changed
- Bumped project version to 5.0.1-SNAPSHOT (PR #127), then released as 5.0.1 (PR #135).
- Refactored GitHub release workflow to parallelise snapshot and release jobs (PR #128).
- Removed snapshot build documentation and badge (PR #131).
- Upgraded Windows CI to `windows-2025` with Visual Studio 2026 (PR #132).
- Switched Windows MSVC runtime from dynamic (`/MD`) to static (`/MT`) to eliminate the `msvcp140.dll` runtime dependency (PR #133).
- Upgraded llama.cpp from b9106 to b9134 (PR #134), then to b9150 (PR #136), then to b9151 (PR #139).
- Refactored CI workflow with explicit snapshot/tag check gates (PR #137).
- Removed `setCtxSizeDraft()` — the underlying CLI flag was deleted upstream in llama.cpp b9106.

### Fixed
- `fix(publish):` quoted gate job names to avoid YAML colon-in-scalar parse errors (PR #138).
- Release routing in the publish workflow now correctly distinguishes snapshot vs. tag pushes.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-11

First release of the fork under the `net.ladenthin:llama` Maven coordinates. ~100 merged pull requests since baseline `49be664` (the last pre-fork upstream commit).

### Added
- First publish to Maven Central under `net.ladenthin:llama`.
- Pre-built native libraries for Linux (x86-64, aarch64), macOS (x86-64, arm64), and Windows (x86-64, x86).
- Java API surface: `LlamaModel`, `ModelParameters`, `InferenceParameters`, `LlamaIterator` / `LlamaIterable` for streaming, chat completion (`chatComplete`, `generateChat`, `chatCompleteText`), embeddings, reranking, infilling, raw JSON endpoint handlers, slot management (`saveSlot`, `restoreSlot`, `eraseSlot`), and `getModelMeta()`.
- `chatComplete()` for OpenAI-compatible chat completions, re-implemented from scratch based on a patch by @vaiju1981 (PR #61; see `CHAT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`).
- `mmproj`, reasoning-budget, sigma, and sleep-idle parameters added to `ModelParameters`.
- JaCoCo code-coverage reporting integrated with Coveralls and Codecov (PR #124).
- CodeQL static-analysis workflow on push, PR, and a weekly schedule.
- Automated Claude Code review workflow on pull requests.
- Dependabot for Maven and GitHub Actions dependency updates.
- Automatic snapshot release workflow on `main` push (PR #105) publishing to the Sonatype Central snapshot repository.
- CUDA, Metal, and Vulkan build support via local CMake build.
- Android integration documented in README.
- All system properties (`net.ladenthin.llama.*`) and `LogLevel` values documented.
- `CLAUDE.md` maintainer guide covering upstream upgrade procedure and the b5022→b9172 breaking-change table.

### Changed
- Migrated Maven group and artifact from `de.kherud:java-llama.cpp` to `net.ladenthin:llama` (PR #101).
- Migrated Maven Central publishing from OSSRH (Legacy) to the Sonatype Central Publisher Portal.
- Deleted the hand-ported `server.hpp` fork (~3,780 lines) and linked the upstream `llama.cpp` server source files directly into `jllama`. ~4,100 C++ lines removed in total; future upstream upgrades become a CMake version bump. **The Java API is unchanged.** See `REFACTORING.md`.
- Compiled upstream server-context / queue / task / models directly into jllama (PR #96).
- Unified CI into a single `publish.yml` workflow with cross-compilation, testing, coverage, and release stages.
- Upgraded CUDA from 12.1 to 13.2 (PR #50).
- Upgraded llama.cpp from b8913 through b9106 across multiple incremental upgrades.
- `setDraftMax` / `setDraftMin` now emit the canonical `--spec-draft-n-max` / `--spec-draft-n-min` flags (llama.cpp b9016 removed the old aliases).
- Bumped CI GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` v4 → v6, `actions/upload-artifact` v6 → v7, `actions/download-artifact` v6 → v8, `codeql-action` v3 → v4.

### Fixed
- Javadoc warnings resolved across the public API by adding missing comments.
- `cache_idle_slots` slot-parameter handling aligned with the upstream rename (b8841 → b8854).
